Haraka can serve thousands of concurrent connections\nand deliver thousands of messages per second. Haraka and plugins are written\nin asynchronous JS and are very fast.  Haraka has very good spam protection (see   plugins ) and works\nwell as a filtering   MTA . It also works well as a   MSA  running on\nport 587 with auth and   dkim_sign  plugins enabled.  Haraka makes no attempt to be a mail store (like Exchange or Postfix/Exim/Qmail),\na   LDA , nor an IMAP server (like Dovecot or Courier). Haraka is\ntypically used   with  such systems.  Haraka has a scalable outbound mail delivery engine built in. Mail\nmarked as   relaying  (such as via an   auth  plugin) is automatically\nqueued for outbound delivery.  Getting Help    Join the mailing list  (implemented as a Haraka plugin)   GitHub Issues  Screencast    Why Use Haraka?  Haraka's plugin architecture provides an easily extensible MTA that\ncomplements traditional MTAs that excel at managing mail stores but do\nnot have sufficient filtering.  The plugin system makes it easy to code new features. A typical example\nis providing qmail-like extended addresses to an Exchange system,\nwhereby you could receive mail as   user-anyword@domain.com , and yet\nstill have it correctly routed to   user@domain.com . This is a few lines of\ncode in Haraka.  Plugins are provided for running mail through   SpamAssassin , validating\n  HELO  names, checking   DNS Blocklists , and   many others .  Installing Haraka  Haraka requires   node.js  to run. Install Haraka with [npm]  2 :      npm   install   -g   Haraka\n     yarn   add   global   Haraka\n     pnpm   add   -g   Haraka\n   If the command gives \"nobody\" errors run the next command      npm   -g   config   set   user   root\n   npm   install   -g   Haraka\n  After installation, use the   haraka  binary to set up the service.  Running Haraka  First, create the service:     haraka   -i   /path/to/haraka_test\n  That creates the directory   haraka_test  with   config  and   plugin \ndirectories within. It also sets the host name used by Haraka\nto the output of   hostname .  If   hostname  is not correct, edit   config/host_list . For example,\nto receive mail addressed to   user@domain.com , add   domain.com  to the\n  config/host_list  file.  Finally, start Haraka using root permissions:     haraka   -c   /path/to/haraka_test\n  And it will run.  Configure Haraka  To choose which plugins run, edit   config/plugins . Plugins control the\noverall behaviour of Haraka. By default, only messages to domains listed\nin   config/host_list  will be accepted and then delivered via the\n  smtp-forward  plugin. Configure the destination in   config/smtp_forward.ini .  Read the Fine Manual     haraka   -h   plugins/  $name\n  The docs detail how each plugin is configured. After editing\n  config/plugins , restart Haraka and enjoy!  Running from git  If you are unable to use npm to install Haraka, you can run from git by\nfollowing these steps:  First clone the repository:     git   clone   https://github.com/haraka/Haraka.git\n   cd   Haraka\n  Install Haraka's node.js dependencies locally:     npm   install\n  Edit   config/plugins  and   config/smtp.ini  to specify the plugins and\nconfig you want.  Finally run Haraka:     node   haraka.js\n  License and Author  Haraka is MIT licensed - see the   LICENSE  file for details.

It came out of Matt Sergeant's experience at MessageLabs/Symantec, building extremely high performance spam traps that had to process thousands of concurrent high latency connections.  Having worked on Qpsmtpd before, the basic design of a plugin system was taken from Qpsmtpd, and applied to a new Node.js mail server.  The original goal was to learn how to code in Node.js, but it turned into so much more.  A Growing User Base  Shortly after releasing the first few working versions, Haraka was noticed by Craigslist. They were looking to implement something similar, likely in C++, but also using an event loop architecture for scalability. Their current Postfix servers were not scaling well enough.  Craigslist extended Haraka and improved many of the core features and plugins. After rollout to their systems they de-commissioned around 50% of their hardware that was wasted by the difficult to extend Postfix system.  At the same time, other high end users, including British anti-spam systems developers FSL, began to notice Haraka.  With many commercial contributors, Haraka has grown into a very capable, stable and scalable mail server.  Adding Outbound  Once Haraka was fully capable of replacing anyone's inbound mail server (where mail arrives for them from the Internet, and where you have to implement the most stringent of Anti-Spam methods), it was time to add a scalable outbound mail sender to Haraka.  We spent many late nights putting together the outbound feature and making sure it was as scalable as the inbound service. Testing shows that it is several times faster than Postfix at sending email.  There's still work to do on outbound, but for most senders it will fit the bill perfectly.  Future Directions  In the future Haraka intends to add features to make the outbound system rival those of commercial large scale mail vendors such as Port 25 and Message Systems.  To do that we need to add a queue management system which scales transparently across clusters. Large receivers of email have specific requirements which are hard to adhere to when you have a cluster of hardware, such as how much mail they are willing to receive in a particular time window.",{"id":32,"path":33,"dir":7,"title":34,"description":35,"keywords":36,"body":39},"content:3.community.md","/community","Community","Haraka has a strong community presence.

Those mails will be delivered to the appropriate MX record\nfor that domain. Mails are queued onto your disk, and will deal appropriately\nwith temporary failures to retry delivery later.  Outbound mails are defined as those that have set the   connection.relaying \nflag to   true  via a plugin. The simplest way of doing that is to use SMTP\nAUTH, and have the client authenticate. For example using the   auth/flat_file \nplugin. However it is very simple to write a custom plugin to do this.  For statistics on outbound mail use the   process_title  plugin. See the\ndocumentation for that plugin for details.  To flush the outbound queue (for temporary failed mails) hit the Haraka master\nprocess with the SIGHUP signal (via the   kill  command line tool).  Outbound Configuration Files  outbound.ini    disabled  Default: false. Allows one to temporarily disable outbound delivery, while\nstill receiving and queuing emails. This can be changed while Haraka is\nrunning.    concurrency_max  Default: 100. Specifies the maximum concurrent connections to make. Note that\nif using cluster (multiple CPUs) then this will be multiplied by the number\nof CPUs that you have.    enable_tls  Default: true. Switch to false to disable TLS for outbound mail.  This uses the same   tls_key.pem  and   tls_cert.pem  files that the   tls \nplugin uses, along with other values in   tls.ini . See the   tls plugin\ndocs  for information on generating those\nfiles.  Within   tls.ini  you can specify global options for the values   ciphers ,\n  requestCert  and   rejectUnauthorized , alternatively you can provide\nseparate values by putting them under a key:   [outbound] , such as:   [outbound]\nciphers=!DES\n    ipv6_enabled  When this has a \"true\" value inside (usually a   1 ), it defaults to an 'AAAA'\nlookup first for each MX record, and uses those hosts to send email via.    always_split  Default: false. By default, Haraka groups message recipients by domain so that\nmessages with multiple recipients at the same domain get sent in a single SMTP\nsession. When   always_split  is enabled, each recipient gets a queue entry and\ndelivery in its own SMTP session. This carries a performance penalty but\nenables more flexibility in mail delivery and bounce handling.    received_header  Default: \"Haraka outbound\". If this text is any string except   disabled , the\nstring is attached as a   Received  header to all outbound mail just before it is queued.    connect_timeout  Timeout for connecting to remote servers. Default: 30s    pool_timeout  Outbound mail uses \"pooled\" connections. An unused pool connection will send\na QUIT after this time. Default: 50s  Pooled connections means that a mail to a particular IP address will hold that\nconnection open and use it the next time it is requested. This helps with\nlarge scale outbound mail. If you don't send lots of mail it is advised to\nlower the   pool_timeout  value since it may upset receiving mail servers.  Setting this value to   0  will effectively disable the use of pools. You may\nwish to set this if you have a   get_mx  hook that picks outbound servers on\na per-email basis (rather than per-domain).    pool_concurrency_max  Set this to   0  to completely disable the pooling code.  This value determines how many concurrent connections can be made to a single\nIP address (destination) in the pool. Default: 10 connections.  outbound.bounce_message  See \"Bounce Messages\" below for details.  The HMail Object  Many hooks (see below) pass in a   hmail  object.  You likely won't ever need to call methods on this object, so they are left\nundocumented here.  The attributes of an   hmail  object that may be of use are:   path - the full path to the queue file  filename - the filename within the queue dir  num_failures - the number of times this mail has been temp failed  notes - notes you can store on a hmail object (similar to   transaction.notes )\nto allow you to pass information between outbound hooks  todo - see below  The ToDo Object  The   todo  object contains information about how to deliver this mail. Keys\nyou may be interested in are:   rcpt_to - an Array of   Address  1  objects - the rfc.2821 recipients of this mail  mail_from - an   Address  1  object - the rfc.2821 sender of this mail  domain - the domain this mail is going to (see   always_split  above)  notes - the original transaction.notes for this mail, also contains the\nfollowing useful keys:\n** outbound_ip - the IP address to bind to (note do not set this manually,\nuse the   get_mx  hook)\n** outbound_helo - the EHLO domain to use (again, do not set manually)  queue_time - the epoch milliseconds time when this mail was queued  uuid - the original transaction.uuid  Outbound Mail Hooks  The queue_outbound hook  The first hook that is called prior to queueing an outbound mail is the\n  queue_outbound  hook. Only if all these hooks return   CONT  (or if there are\nno hooks) will the mail be queued for outbound delivery. A return of   OK  will\nindicate that the mail has been queued in some custom manner for outbound\ndelivery. Any of the   DENY  return codes will cause the message to be\nappropriately rejected.  The send_email hook  Parameters:   next, hmail  Called just as the email is about to be sent.  Respond with   next(DELAY, delay_seconds)  to defer sending the email at this time.  The get_mx hook  Parameters:   next, hmail, domain  Upon starting delivery the   get_mx  hook is called, with the parameter set to\nthe domain in question (for example a mail to   user@example.com  will call the\n  get_mx  hook with   (next, hmail, domain)  as parameters). This is to allow\nyou to implement a custom handler to find MX records. For most installations\nthere is no reason to implement this hook - Haraka will find the correct MX\nrecords for you.  The MX record is sent via next(OK, mx) and can be one of:   A string of one of the following formats:\n   hostname  hostname:port  ipaddress  ipaddress:port  An MX object of the form:   {priority: 0, exchange: hostname}  with the\nfollowing optional properies:\n*   port  to specify an alternate port\n*   bind  to specify an outbound IP address to bind to\n*   bind_helo  to specify an outbound helo for IP address to bind to\n*   using_lmtp  boolean to specify that delivery should be attempted using\nLMTP instead of SMTP.\n*    auth_user  to specify an AUTH username (required if AUTH is desired)\n*    auth_pass  to specify an AUTH password (required if AUTH is desired)\n*    auth_type  to specify an AUTH type that should be used with the MX.\nIf this is not specified then Haraka will pick an appropriate method.  A list of MX objects in an array, each in the same format as above.  The deferred hook  Parameters:   next, hmail, {delay: ..., err: ...}  If the mail is temporarily deferred, the   deferred  hook is called. The hook\nparameter is an object with keys:   delay  and   err , which explain the delay\n(in seconds) and error message.  If you want to stop at this point, and drop the mail completely, then you\ncan call   next(OK) .  If you want to change the delay, then call   next(DENYSOFT, delay_in_seconds) .\nUsing this you can define a custom delay algorithm indexed by\n  hmail.num_failures .  The bounce hook  Parameters:   next, hmail, error  If the mail completely bounces then the   bounce  hook is called. This is   not \ncalled if the mail is issued a temporary failure (a 4xx error code). The hook\nparameter is the error message received from the remote end as an   Error  object.\nThe object may also have the following properties:   mx - the MX object that caused the bounce  deferred_rcpt - the deferred recipients that eventually bounced  bounced_rcpt - the bounced recipients  If you do not wish to have a bounce message sent to the originating sender of the\nemail then you can return   OK  from this hook to stop it from sending a bounce message.  The delivered hook  Parameters:   next, hmail, params  Params is a list of:   [host, ip, response, delay, port, mode, ok_recips, secured]  When mails are successfully delivered to the remote end then the   delivered \nhook is called. The return codes from this hook have no effect, so it is only\nuseful for logging the fact that a successful delivery occurred.    host  - Hostname of the MX that the message was delivered to,   ip  - IP address of the host that the message was delivered to,   response  - Variable contains the SMTP response text returned by the host\nthat received the message and will typically contain the remote queue ID and   delay  - Time taken between the queue file being created and the\nmessage being delivered.   port  - Port number that the message was delivered to.   mode  - Shows whether SMTP or LMTP was used to deliver the mail.   ok_recips  - an   Address  1  array containing all of the recipients that were\nsuccessfully delivered to.   secured  - A boolean denoting if the connection used TLS or not.  Outbound IP address  Normally the OS will decide which IP address will be used for outbound\nconnections using the IP routing table.  There are instances where you may want to separate outbound traffic on\ndifferent IP addresses based on sender, domain or some other identifier.  \nTo do this, the IP address that you want to use   must  be bound to an\ninterface (or alias) on the local system.  As described above the outbound IP can be set using the   bind  parameter\nand also the outbound helo for the IP can be set using the   bind_ehlo \nparameter returned my the   get_mx  hook or during the reception of the message\nyou can set a transaction note in a plugin to tell Haraka which outbound IP\naddress you would like it to use when it tries to deliver the message:   connection.transaction.notes.outbound_ip = '1.2.3.4';\nconnection.transaction.notes.outbound_helo = 'mail-2.example.com';\n  Note: if the   get_mx  hook returns a   bind  and   bind_helo  parameter, then\nthis will be used in preference to the transaction note.  AUTH  If you wish to use AUTH for a particular domain or domains, or you wish to\nforce all mail to an outbound service or smart host that requires authentication\nthen you can use the   get_mx  hook documented above to do this by supplying\nboth   auth_user  and   auth_pass  properties in an MX object.  If AUTH properties are supplied and the remote end does not offer AUTH or there\nare no compatible AUTH methods, then the message will be sent without AUTH and\na warning will be logged.  Bounce Messages  The contents of the bounce message are configured by a file called\n  config/outbound.bounce_message . If you look at this file you will see it\ncontains several template entries wrapped in curly brackets. These will be\npopulated as follows:  Optional: Possibility to add HTML code (with optional image) to the bounce message is possible\nby adding the files   config/outbound.bounce_message_html . An image can be attached\nto the mail by using   config/outbound.bounce_message_image .   pid - the current process id  date - the current date when the bounce occurred  me - the contents of   config/me  from - the originating sender of the message  msgid - a uuid for the mail  to - the end recipient of the message, or the first recipient if it was to\nmultiple people  reason - the text from the remote server indicating why it bounced  Following the bounce message itself will be a copy of the entire original\nmessage.  Creating a mail internally for outbound delivery  Sometimes it is necessary to generate a new mail from within a plugin.  To do that, you can use the   outbound  module directly:     var   outbound   =   require  (  './outbound'  );\n   \n   var   plugin   =   this  ;\n   \n   var   to   =   'user@example.com'  ;\n   var   from   =   'sender@example.com'  ;\n   \n   var   contents   =   [\n       \"From: \"   +   from,\n       \"To: \"   +   to,\n       \"MIME-Version: 1.0\"  ,\n       \"Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\"  ,\n       \"Subject: Some subject here\"  ,\n       \"\"  ,\n       \"Some email body here\"  ,\n       \"\"  ].  join  (  \"  \\n  \"  );\n       \n   var   outnext   =   function   (  code  ,   msg  ) {\n       switch   (code) {\n           case   DENY  :  plugin.  logerror  (  \"Sending mail failed: \"   +   msg);\n                       break  ;\n           case   OK  :    plugin.  loginfo  (  \"mail sent\"  );\n                       next  ();\n                       break  ;\n           default  :    plugin.  logerror  (  \"Unrecognized return code from sending email: \"   +   msg);\n                       next  ();\n       }\n   };\n   \n   outbound.  send_email  (from, to, contents, outnext);\n  The callback on   send_email()  is passed   OK  if the mail is successfully\nqueued to disk, not when it is successfully delivered. To check delivery\nstatus you still need to hook   delivered  and   bounce  to know if it was\nsuccessfully delivered.  The callback parameter may be omitted if you don't need to handle errors\nshould queueing to disk fail e.g:     outbound.  send_email  (from, to, contents);\n  You can pass various options to   outbound.send_email  like so:     outbound.  send_email  (from, to, contents, outnext, options);\n  Where   options  is a Object that may contain the following keys:     Key/Value  Description     dot_stuffed: true  Use this if you are passing your content dot-stuffed (a dot at the start of a line is doubled, like it is in SMTP conversation, see   RFC 2821 .    notes: { key: value}  In case you need notes in the new transaction that   send_email()  creates.    remove_msgid: true  Remove any Message-Id header found in the message.  If you are reading a message in from the filesystem and you want to ensure that a generated Message-Id header is used in preference over the original.  This is useful if you are releasing mail from a quarantine.    remove_date: true  Remove any Date header found in the message.  If you are reading a message in from the filesystem and you want to ensure that a generated Date header is used in preference over the original.  This is useful if you are releasing mail from a quarantine.    origin: Object  Adds object as argument to logger.log calls inside outbound.send_email.

Mail cannot even be received unless at least a 'rcpt' and 'queue' plugin are\nenabled.  Recipient (  rcpt ) plugins determine if a particular recipient is allowed to be relayed or received for. A   queue  plugin queues the message somewhere - normally to disk or to an another SMTP server.  Plugin Lists  Get a list of installed plugins by running   haraka -l . To include locally installed plugins, add the   -c /path/to/config  option.  We also have a   registry of known plugins .  Display the help text for a plugin by running:     haraka   -h   \u003C  nam  e  >   -c   /path/to/config`\n  Writing Haraka Plugins  Anatomy of a Plugin  Plugins in Haraka are JS files in the   plugins  directory (legacy) and npm\nmodules in the node_modules directory. See \"Plugins as Modules\" below.  Plugins can be installed in the Haraka global directory (default:\n/$os/$specific/lib/node_modules/Haraka) or in the Haraka install directory\n(whatever you chose when you typed   haraka -i . Example:   haraka -i /etc/haraka  To enable a plugin, add its name to   config/plugins . For npm packaged plugins, the name does not include the   haraka-plugin  prefix.  Register  Register is the only plugin function that is syncronous and receives no arguments. Its primary purpose is enabling your plugin to register SMTP hooks. It is also used for syncronous initialization tasks such as   loading a config file . For heavier initialization tasks such as establishing database connections, look to   init_master  and   init_child  instead.  Register a Hook  There are two ways for plugins to register hooks. Both examples register a function on the   rcpt  hook:   The   register_hook  function in register():  exports.register = function() {\nthis.register_hook('rcpt', 'my_rcpt_validate');\n};  exports.my_rcpt_validate = function (next, connection, params) {\n// do processing\nnext();\n};  The hook_  $name  syntax:  exports.hook_rcpt = function (next, connection, params) {\n// do processing\nnext();\n};  The register_hook function within   register()  offers a few advantages:   1. register a hook multiple times (see below)\n2. a unique function name in stack traces\n3. [a better function name](https://google.com/search?q=programming%20good%20function%20names)\n4. hooks can be registered conditionally (ie, based on a config setting)\n  Register a Hook Multiple Times  To register the same hook more than once, call   register_hook()  multiple times with the same hook name:     exports  .  register   =   function  () {\n       this  .  register_hook  (  'queue'  ,   'try_queue_my_way'  );\n       this  .  register_hook  (  'queue'  ,   'try_queue_highway'  );\n   };\n  When   try_queue_my_way()  calls   next() , the next function registered on hook   queue  will be called, in this case,   try_queue_highway() .  Determine hook name  When a single function runs on multiple hooks, the function can check the\n  hook  property of the   connection  or   hmail  argument to determine which hook it is running on:     exports  .  register   =   function  () {\n       this  .  register_hook  (  'rcpt'  ,      'my_rcpt'  );\n       this  .  register_hook  (  'rcpt_ok'  ,   'my_rcpt'  );\n   };\n    \n   exports  .  my_rcpt   =   function   (  next  ,   connection  ,   params  ) {\n       var   hook_name   =   connection.hook;   // rcpt or rcpt_ok\n       // email address is in params[0]\n       // do processing\n   }\n  Next()  After registering a hook, functions are called with that hooks arguments (see   Available Hooks  below. The first argument is a callback function, conventionally named   next . When the function is completed, it calls   next()  and the connection continues. Failing to call   next()  will result in the connection hanging until that plugin's timer expires.   next([code, msg])  accepts two optional parameters:    code  is one of the listed return codes.   msg  is a string to send to the client in case of a failure. Use an array to send a multi-line message.   msg  should NOT contain the code number - that is handled by Haraka.  Next() Return Codes  These constants are in your plugin when it is loaded, you do not\nneed to define them:   CONT  Continue and let other plugins handle this particular hook. This is the\ndefault. These are identical:   next()  and   next(CONT) ;  DENY - Reject with a 5xx error.  DENYSOFT - Reject with a 4xx error.  DENYDISCONNECT - Reject with a 5xx error and immediately disconnect.  DISCONNECT - Immediately disconnect  OK  Required by   rcpt  plugins to accept a recipient and   queue  plugins when the queue was successful.  After a plugin calls   next(OK) , no further plugins on that hook will run.  Exceptions to next(OK):   connect_init and disconnect hooks are   always called .  On the deny hook,   next(OK)  overrides the default CONT.  HOOK_NEXT  HOOK_NEXT is only available on the   unrecognized_command  hook. It instructs Haraka to run a different plugin hook. The   msg  argument must be set to the name of the hook to be run. Ex:   next(HOOK_NEXT, 'rcpt_ok');  Available Hooks  These are the hook and their parameters (next excluded):   init_master - called when the main (master) process is started  init_child - in cluster, called when a child process is started  init_http - called when Haraka is started.  init_wss - called after init_http  connect_init - used to init data structures, called for   every  connection  lookup_rdns - called to look up the rDNS - return the rDNS via   next(OK, rdns)  connect - called after we got rDNS  capabilities - called to get the ESMTP capabilities (such as STARTTLS)  unrecognized_command - called when the remote end sends a command we don't recognise  disconnect - called upon disconnect  helo (hostname)  ehlo (hostname)  quit  vrfy  noop  rset  mail (  from, esmtp_params )  rcpt (  to,   esmtp_params )  rcpt_ok (to)  data - called at the DATA command  data_post - called at the end-of-data marker  max_data_exceeded - called when the message exceeds connection.max_bytes  queue - called to queue the mail  queue_outbound - called to queue the mail when connection.relaying is set  queue_ok - called when a mail has been queued successfully  reset_transaction - called before the transaction is reset (via RSET, or MAIL)  deny - called when a plugin returns DENY, DENYSOFT or DENYDISCONNECT  get_mx (hmail, domain) - called by outbound to resolve the MX record  deferred (hmail, params) - called when an outbound message is deferred  bounce (hmail, err) - called when an outbound message bounces  delivered (hmail,   host, ip, response, delay, port, mode, ok_recips, secured, authenticated ) - called when outbound mail is delivered  send_email (hmail) - called when outbound is about to be sent  pre_send_trans_email (fake_connection) - called just before an email is queued to disk with a faked connection object  rcpt  The   rcpt  hook is slightly special.  When   connection.relaying == false  (the default, to avoid being an open relay), a rcpt plugin MUST return   next(OK)  or the sender will receive the error message \"I cannot deliver for that user\". The default   rcpt  plugin  is   rcpt_to.in_host_list , which lists the domains for which to accept email.  After a   rcpt  plugin calls   next(OK) , the   rcpt_ok  hook is run.  If a plugin prior to the   rcpt  hook sets   connection.relaying = true , then it is not necessary for a rcpt plugin to call   next(OK) .  connect_init  The   connect_init  hook is unique in that all return codes are ignored. This is so that plugins that need to do initialization for every connection can be assured they will run. Return values are ignored.  hook_init_http (next, Server)  If http listeners are are enabled in http.ini and the express module loaded, the express library will be located at Server.http.express. More importantly, the express   app / instance  will be located at Server.http.app. Plugins can register routes on the app just as they would with any   Express.js  app.  hook_init_wss (next, Server)  If express loaded, an attempt is made to load   ws , the websocket server. If it succeeds, the wss server will be located at Server.http.wss. Because of how websockets work, only one websocket plugin will work at a time. One plugin using wss is   watch .  pre_send_trans_email (next, fake_connection)  The   fake  connection here is a holder for a new transaction object. It only has the log methods and a   transaction  property\nso don't expect it to behave like a a real connection object. This hook is designed so you can add headers and modify mails\nsent via   outbound.send_email() , see the dkim_sign plugin for an example.  Hook Order  The ordering of hooks is determined by the SMTP protocol. Knowledge of   RFC 5321  is beneficial.  Typical Inbound Connection   hook_connect_init  hook_lookup_rdns  hook_connect  hook_helo   OR  hook_ehlo (EHLO is sent when ESMTP is desired which allows extensions\nsuch as STARTTLS, AUTH, SIZE etc.)\n   hook_helo  hook_ehlo\n   hook_capabilities   hook_unrecognized_command  is run for each ESMTP extension the client requests\ne.g. STARTTLS, AUTH etc.)  hook_mail  hook_rcpt (once per-recipient)  hook_rcpt_ok (for every recipient that hook_rcpt returned   next(OK)  for)  hook_data    attachment hooks  hook_data_post  hook_queue   OR  hook_queue_outbound  hook_queue_ok (called if hook_queue or hook_queue_outbound returns   next(OK) )  hook_quit   OR  hook_rset   OR  hook_helo   OR  hook_ehlo (after a message has been sent or rejected, the client can disconnect or start a new transaction with RSET, EHLO or HELO)\n   hook_reset_transaction  hook_disconnect  Typical Outbound mail  By 'outbound' we mean messages using Haraka's built-in queue and delivery\nmechanism. The Outbound queue is used when   connection.relaying = true  is set during the  transaction and   hook_queue_outbound  is called to queue the message.  The Outbound hook ordering mirrors the Inbound hook order above until after   hook_queue_outbound , which is followed by:   hook_send_email  hook_get_mx  at least one of:\n   hook_delivered  (once per delivery domain with at least one successful recipient)  hook_deferred  (once per delivery domain where at least one recipient or connection was deferred)  hook_bounce  (once per delivery domain where the recipient(s) or message was rejected by the destination)  Plugin Run Order  Plugins are run on each hook in the order that they are specified in   config/plugins . When a plugin returns anything other than   next()  on a hook, all subsequent plugins due to run on that hook are skipped (exceptions: connect_init, disconnect).  This is important as some plugins might rely on   results  or   notes  that have been set by plugins that need to run before them. This should be noted in the plugins documentation. Make sure to read it.  If you are writing a complex plugin, you may have to split it into multiple plugins to run in a specific order e.g. you want hook_deny to run last after all other plugins and hook_lookup_rdns to run first, then you can explicitly register your hooks and provide a   priority  value which is an integer between -100 (highest priority) to 100 (lowest priority) which defaults to 0 (zero) if not supplied.  You can apply a priority to your hook in the following way:     exports  .  register   =   function  () {\n       var   plugin   =   this  ;\n       plugin.  register_hook  (  'connect'  ,    'hook_connect'  ,   -  100  );\n   }\n  This would ensure that your hook_connect function will run before any other\nplugins registered on the   connect  hook, regardless of the order it was\nspecified in   config/plugins .  Check the order that the plugins will run on each hook by running:     haraka   -o   -c   /path/to/config\n  Skipping Plugins  Plugins can be skipped at runtime by pushing the name of the plugin into the   skip_plugins  array in   transaction.notes .  This array is reset for every transaction and once a plugin is added to the list, it will not run any hooks in that plugin for the remainder of the transaction.  For example, one could create a whitelist plugin that skipped   spamassassin  if the sender was in a whitelist.  Logging  Plugins inherit all the logging methods of   logger.js , which are:   logprotocol  logdebug  loginfo  lognotice  logwarn  logerror  logcrit  logalert  logemerg  If plugins throw an exception when in a hook, the exception will be caught\nand generate a logcrit level error. However, exceptions will not be caught\nas gracefully when plugins are running async code. Use error codes for that,\nlog the error, and run your next() function appropriately.  Sharing State  There are several cases where you might need to share information between\nplugins.  This is done using   notes  - there are three types available:   server.notes  Available in all plugins.  This is created at PID start-up and is shared\namongst all plugins on the same PID and listener.\nTypical uses for notes at this level would be to share database\nconnections between multiple plugins or connection pools etc.  connection.notes  Available on any hook that passes 'connection' as a function parameter.\nThis is shared amongst all plugins for a single connection and is\ndestroyed after the client disconnects.\nTypical uses for notes at this level would be to store information\nabout the connected client e.g. rDNS names, HELO/EHLO, white/black\nlist status etc.  connection.transaction.notes  Available on any hook that passes 'connection' as a function parameter\nbetween hook_mail and hook_data_post.\nThis is shared amongst all plugins for this transaction (e.g. MAIL FROM\nthrough until a message is received or the connection is reset).\nTypical uses for notes at this level would be to store information\non things like greylisting which uses client, sender and recipient\ninformation etc.  hmail.todo.notes  Available on any outbound hook that passes   hmail  as a function parameter.\nThis is the same object as 'connection.transaction.notes', so anything\nyou store in the transaction notes is automatically available in the\noutbound functions here.  All of these notes are JS objects - use them as simple key/value store e.g.     connection.transaction.notes.test   =   'testing'  ;\n  Plugins as Modules  Plugins as NPM modules are named with the   haraka-plugin  prefix. Therefore, a\nplugin that frobnobricates might be called   haraka-plugin-frobnobricate  and\npublished to NPM with that name. The prefix is not required in the\n  config/plugins  file.  Plugins loaded as NPM modules behave slightly different than plugins loaded\nas plain JS files.  Plain JS plugins have a custom   require()  which allows loading core Haraka\nmodules via specifying   require('./name')  (note the   ./  prefix). Although\nthe core modules aren't in the same folder, the custom   require  intercepts\nthis and look for core modules. Note that if there is a module in your plugins\nfolder of the same name that will not take preference, so avoid using names\nsimilar to core modules.  Plugins loaded as modules do not have the special   require() . To load\na core Haraka module you must use   this.haraka_require('name') .\nThis should also be preferred for plain JS plugins, as the\n  ./  hack is likely to be removed in the future.  Plugins loaded as modules are not compiled in the Haraka plugin sandbox,\nwhich blocks access to certain globals and provides a global   server  object.\nTo access the   server  object, use   connection.server  instead.  Module plugins support default config in their local   config  directory. See the\n\"Default Config and Overrides\" section in   Config .  Shutdown  On graceful reload, Haraka will call a plugin's   shutdown  method.  This is so you can clear any timers or intervals, or shut down any connections\nto remote servers. See   Issue 2024 .  e.g.     exports  .  shutdown   =   function   () {\n       clearInterval  (  this  ._interval);\n   }\n  If you don't implement this in your plugin and have a connection open or a\ntimer running then Haraka will take 30 seconds to shut down and have to\nforcibly kill your process.  Note: This only applies when running with a   nodes=...  value in smtp.ini.  See also,   Results  Further Reading  Read about the   Connection  object.

Note this is RAW email - it isn't useful\nfor adding banners to the email.   transaction.notes  A safe place to store transaction specific values. See also   haraka-results  and   haraka-notes .   transaction.add_leading_header(key, value)  Adds a header to the top of the header list.  This should only be used in\nvery specific cases.  Most people will want to use   add_header()  instead.   transaction.add_header(key, value)  Adds a header to the email.   transaction.remove_header(key)  Deletes a header from the email.   transaction.header  The header of the email. See   Header Object .   transaction.parse_body = true|false   default: false  Set to   true  to enable parsing of the mail body. Make sure you set this in\nhook_data or before.   transaction.body  The body of the email if you set   parse_body  above. See   Body Object .   transaction.attachment_hooks(start)  Sets a callback for when we see an attachment if   parse_body  has been set.  The   start  event will receive   (content_type, filename, body, stream)  as\nparameters.  The stream is a   ReadableStream  - see   http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html  for\ndetails on how this works.  If you set stream.connection then the stream will apply backpressure to the\nconnection, allowing you to process attachments before the connection has\nended. Here is an example which stores attachments in temporary files using\nthe   tmp  library from npm and tells us the size of the file:     exports  .  hook_data   =   function   (  next  ,   connection  ) {\n       // enable mail body parsing\n       connection.transaction.parse_body   =   true  ;\n       connection.transaction.  attachment_hooks  (\n           function   (  ct  ,   fn  ,   body  ,   stream  ) {\n               start_att  (connection, ct, fn, body, stream)\n           }\n       );\n       next  ();\n   }\n   \n   function   start_att   (  connection  ,   ct  ,   fn  ,   body  ,   stream  ) {\n       connection.  loginfo  (  \"Got attachment: \"   +   ct   +   \", \"   +   fn   +   \" for user id: \"   +   connection.transaction.notes.hubdoc_user.email);\n       connection.transaction.notes.attachment_count  ++  ;\n   \n       stream.connection   =   connection;   // Allow backpressure\n       stream.  pause  ();\n   \n       var   tmp   =   require  (  'tmp'  );\n   \n       tmp.  file  (  function   (  err  ,   path  ,   fd  ) {\n           connection.  loginfo  (  \"Got tempfile: \"   +   path   +   \" (\"   +   fd   +   \")\"  );\n           var   ws   =   fs.  createWriteStream  (path);\n           stream.  pipe  (ws);\n           stream.  resume  ();\n           ws.  on  (  'close'  ,   function   () {\n               connection.  loginfo  (  \"End of stream reached\"  );\n               fs.  fstat  (fd,   function   (  err  ,   stats  ) {\n                   connection.  loginfo  (  \"Got data of length: \"   +   stats.size);\n                   // Close the tmp file descriptor\n                   fs.  close  (fd,   function  (){});\n               });\n           });\n       });\n   }\n   transaction.discard_data = true|false   default: false  Set this flag to true to discard all data as it arrives and not store in\nmemory or on disk (in the message_stream property). You can still access\nthe attachments and body if you set parse_body to true. This is useful\nfor systems which do not need the full email, just the attachments or\nmail text.   transaction.set_banner(text, html)  Sets a banner to be added to the end of the email. If the html part is not\ngiven (optional) then the text part will have each line ending replaced with\n  \u003Cbr/>  when being inserted into HTML parts.   transaction.add_body_filter(ct_match, filter)  Adds a filter to be applied to body parts in the email.  ct_match should be a\nregular expression to match against the full content-type line, or a string to\nmatch at the start, e.g.   /^text\\/html/  or   'text/plain' .  filter will be\ncalled when each body part matching ct_match is complete.  It receives three\nparameters, the content-type line, the encoding name, and a buffer with the\nfull body part.  It should return a buffer with the desired contents of the\nbody in the same encoding.   transaction.results  Store results of processing in a structured format.

This\nmakes programming very easy, and is hence why we started using them in Haraka\nstarting with version 2.0.0.  For more information about the Stream API, see\n  http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html  It's important to note that if you are using standard Haraka plugins then\nit's very unlikely you will need to change anything. Though you may want\nto configure   spool_dir  and   spool_after  in   config/smtp.ini . However if\nyou have written custom plugins, continue reading.  Changes To Look For  Firstly, the incoming data in an email (the email body) is now stored in an\nobject which you can treat as a ReadableStream. To find if this is relevant\nfor you, look for instances of   data_lines  in your plugins.  Secondly, if you parse the mail body, attachments are now provided as a\nstream, rather than custom start/data/end events. To find if this is relevant\nfor you, look for instances of   attachment_hooks  in your plugins.  Fixing data_lines plugins  Any plugins now working on each line of data will need to change to using a\nstream. The stream is called   transaction.message_stream .  These changes may be complicated if you are iterating over each line and\ndoing something with the strings therein. However if you are piping the data\nto an application or over a network, your code will become significantly\nsimpler (and a lot faster).  In v1.x Haraka populated the   transaction.data_lines  array for each line of\ndata received.  If you were writing the data to a socket then you had to handle backpressure manually by checking the return of   write()  and adding\n  on('drain')  handlers like so:     var   data_marker   =   0  ;\n   var   in_data   =   false  ;\n   var   end_pending   =   true  ;\n   var   send_data   =   function   () {\n       in_data   =   true  ;\n       var   wrote_all   =   true  ;\n       while   (wrote_all   &&   (data_marker   \u003C   connection.transaction.data_lines.  length  )) {\n           var   line   =   connection.transaction.data_lines[data_marker];\n           data_marker  ++  ;\n           wrote_all   =   socket.  write  (Buffer.  from  (line.  replace  (  /  ^  \\.  /  ,   '..'  ).  replace  (  /  \\r  ?  \\n  /  g  ,   '  \\r\\n  '  )),   'binary'  );\n           if   (  !  wrote_all)   return  ;\n       }\n       // we get here if wrote_all still true, and we got to end of data_lines\n       if   (end_pending) {\n           end_pending   =   false  ;\n           // Finished...\n           socket.  send_command  (  'dot'  );\n       }\n   };\n   socket.  on  (  'drain'  ,   function   () {\n       if   (end_pending   &&   in_data) {\n           setImmediate  (  function   () {   send_data  () });\n       }\n   });\n  In v2.x this now becomes:     connection.transaction.message_stream.  pipe  (socket, {dot_stuffing:   true  , ending_dot:   true  });\n  This automatically chunks the data, handles backpressure and will apply any\nnecessary format changes.  See   docs/Transaction.md  for the full details.  If you need to handle the input data by line, then you will need to create\nyour own writable stream and then pipe the message to the stream and then\nextract the lines from the stream of data.  See   plugins/dkim_sign.js  for\nan example.  Fixing attachment_hooks plugins  For v1.x you passed in functions to   transaction.attachment_hooks()  as\nfollows:     transaction.  attachment_hooks  (\n       function   (  ctype  ,   filename  ,   body  ) {  ...  },   // start\n       function   (  buf  ) {  ...  },   // data\n       function   () {  ...  }   // end\n   );\n  That has now changed to:     transaction.  attachment_hooks  (\n       function   (  ctype  ,   filename  ,   body  ,   stream  ) {  ...  },   // start\n   );\n  This allows you to attach the stream to other streams via   stream.pipe(dest) .  Sometimes destination streams will apply backpressure on the sending stream,\nfor example if you are sending attachments to a remote service. In order\nfor this backpressure to apply to the connection itself (so that we don't\nhave to buffer up data in memory), we need to provide the connection object\nto the stream:     var   transaction   =   connection.transaction;\n   transaction.  attachment_hooks  (\n       function   (  ctype  ,   filename  ,   body  ,   stream  ) {\n           stream.connection   =   connection;\n           ...\n       }\n   );\n  For a full example of using attachment streams, see the Transaction.md\ndocumentation file.  html .dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html.dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}",{"id":187,"path":188,"dir":178,"title":189,"description":190,"keywords":191,"body":194},"content:7.tutorials:SettingUpOutbound.md","/tutorials/settingupoutbound","Configuring Haraka For Outbound Email","It is trivially easy to configure Haraka as an outbound email server. But\nfirst there are external things you may want to sort out:",[192,193],"First Some Background","The Setup","  Configuring Outbound Email  It is trivially easy to configure Haraka as an outbound email server. But\nfirst there are external things you may want to sort out:   Get your DNS PTR record working - make sure it matches the A record of the\nhost you are sending from.  Consider implementing an SPF record. I don't personally do this, but some\npeople seem to think it helps.  There's lots of information elsewhere on the internet about getting these\nthings working, and they are specific to your network and your DNS hosting.  First Some Background  Sending outbound mail through Haraka is called \"relaying\", and that is the\nterm the internals use. The process is simple - if a plugin in Haraka tells\nthe internals that this mail is to be relayed, then it gets queued in the\n\"queue\" directory for delivery. Then it will go through several delivery\nattempts until it is either successful or fails hard for some reason. A\nhard failure will result in a bounce email being sent to the \"MAIL FROM\"\naddress used when connecting to Haraka. If that address also bounces then\nit is considered a \"double bounce\" and Haraka will log an error and drop it\non the floor.  The Setup  Outbound mail servers should run on port 587 and enforce authentication. This\nis slightly different from the \"old\" model where there would simply be a\ncheck based on the connecting IP address to see if it was valid to relay.\nNote however that Haraka doesn't stop you doing it this way - we just don't\nprovide a plugin to do that by default - you will have to write one. The\nreason is purely based on security and personal preference.  Let's create a new Haraka instance:   haraka -i haraka-outbound\ncd haraka-outbound\n  Now edit config/smtp.ini - change the port to 587.  Next we setup our plugins - all we need is the tls and auth plugin. AUTH capability is only advertised after TLS/SSL negotiation (except for connections from the local host):   echo \"tls\nauth/flat_file\" > config/plugins\n  Now edit the flat file password file, and put in an appropriate username\nand password:   vi config/auth_flat_file.ini\n  See the documentation in docs/plugins/auth/flat_file.md for information about\nwhat can go in that file.  Now you can start Haraka. That's all the configuration you need.   haraka -c .\n  Now in another window you can run swaks to test this - be sure to substitute\nan email address you can monitor in place of   youremail@yourdomain.com , and the\nusername and password you added for the --auth-user and --auth-password params:   swaks --to youremail@yourdomain.com --from test@example.com --server localhost \\\n  --port 587 --auth-user testuser --auth-password testpassword\n  Watch the output of swaks and ensure no errors have occurred. Then watch\nthe recipient email address (easiest to make this your webmail account) and\nsee that the email arrived.

Of course in order to control this you may at some point need to edit some\nsort of plugin file of your own to customise how things work. The good news\nis that writing plugins in Haraka is simple, even for novice coders. You\njust need a little knowledge of Javascript (and maybe some understanding of\nNode.js) and the world is your oyster.  This tutorial will run through a simple plugin which allows you to have\nemail addresses that expire in a short period of time. This is handy if you\nwant a   disposable email address  to use to sign up for a web site that you\ndon't wish to continually receive communication from.  The Design  In order to make this simple, we are going to simply let you have tagged\nemail addresses such as   user-20120515@domain.com  which will expire on the\n15th May, 2012. Haraka will then check the email has yet to expire, and\nreject mails to that address after the expiry date. If the address hasn't\nexpired yet it will re-write the address to   user@domain.com  before onward\ndelivery.  What You Will Need   Node.js and npm  Haraka  A text editor   swaks  A screwdriver  Getting Started  First install Haraka via npm if you haven't already:     sudo   npm   -g   install   Haraka\n  Now we can create our project directory to get started with:     haraka   -i   /path/to/new_project\n  Make sure you use a directory that doesn't exist for your project.  Next, let's create a new plugin:     haraka   -c   /path/to/new_project   -p   rcpt_to.disposable\n  This should output a bunch of information about files it has created:     Plugin   rcpt_to.disposable   created\n   Now   edit   javascript   in:      /path/to/new_project/plugins/rcpt_to.disposable.js\n   Add   the   plugin   to   config:    /path/to/new_project/config/plugins\n   And   edit   documentation   in:   /path/to/new_project/docs/plugins/rcpt_to.disposable.md\n  So let's do the second part now - load up the   config/plugins  file and lets\nset this up to test things. Comment out most of the plugins, except for\n  rcpt_to.in_host_list  and add in our new plugin, and change the queue\nplugin to   test_queue . The final file should look like this:     # default list of plugins\n   \n   # block mails from known bad hosts (see config/dnsbl.zones for the DNS zones queried)\n   #dnsbl\n   \n   # allow bad mail signatures from the config/data.signatures file.\n   #data.signatures\n   \n   # block mail from some known bad HELOs - see config/helo.checks.ini for configuration\n   #helo.checks\n   \n   # block mail from known bad email addresses you put in config/mail_from.blocklist\n   #mail_from.blocklist\n   \n   # Only accept mail where the MAIL FROM domain is resolvable to an MX record\n   #mail_from.is_resolvable\n   \n   # Allow dated tagged addresses\n   rcpt_to.disposable\n   \n   # Only accept mail for your personal list of hosts\n   rcpt_to.in_host_list\n   \n   # Queue mail via qmail-queue\n   #queue/qmail-queue\n   \n   queue/test\n  Remember that the ordering here is important - our new plugin has to come\nbefore   rcpt_to.in_host_list .  Now fire up your favourite editor and put the following into\nthe   plugins/rcpt_to.disposable.js  file:     exports  .  hook_rcpt   =   function   (  next  ,   connection  ,   params  ) {\n       var   rcpt   =   params[  0  ];\n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Got recipient: \"   +   rcpt);\n       next  ();\n   }\n  All we are doing here is logging the fact that we got the recipient.  Check this works. You'll need two terminal windows. In window 1:     echo   LOGDEBUG   >   config/loglevel\n   echo   myserver.com   >>   config/host_list\n   sudo   haraka   -c   /path/to/new_project\n  And in window 2:     swaks   -h   domain.com   -t   booya@myserver.com   -f   somewhere@example.com   \\\n   -s   localhost   -p   25\n  In the logs you should see:     [INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Got recipient:   \u003C  booya@myserver.com  >\n  Which indicates everything is working. You should also have a file\n  /tmp/mail.eml  containing the email that swaks sent.  Parsing Out The Date  Now lets check for emails with an expire date in them and turn them into\n  Date  objects. Edit your plugin file as follows:     exports  .  hook_rcpt   =   function   (  next  ,   connection  ,   params  ) {\n       var   rcpt   =   params[  0  ];\n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Got recipient: \"   +   rcpt);\n       \n       // Check user matches regex 'user-YYYYMMDD':\n       var   match   =   /  ^  (  .  *  )-(  \\d  {4}  )(  \\d  {2}  )(  \\d  {2}  )  $  /  .  exec  (rcpt.user);\n       if   (  !  match) {\n           return   next  ();\n       }\n       \n       // get date - note Date constructor takes month-1 (i.e. Dec == 11).\n       var   expiry_date   =   new   Date  (match[  2  ], match[  3  ]  -  1  , match[  4  ]);\n       \n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Email expires on: \"   +   expiry_date);\n       \n       next  ();\n   }\n  Start haraka again and pass it the following email via swaks:     swaks   -h   domain.com   -t   booya-20120101@myserver.com   \\\n     -f   somewhere@example.com   -s   localhost   -p   25\n  And you should see now in the logs:     [INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Got recipient:   \u003C  booya-20120101@myserver.com  >\n   [INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Email expires on: Sun, 01 Jan 2012 05:00:00 GMT\n  The exact time may vary depending on your timezone, but it should be obvious\nwe now have a date object, which we can now compare to the current date.  Rejecting Expired Emails  The next edit we have to do is to add in code to compare to the current date\nand reject expired emails. Again, this is very simple:     exports  .  hook_rcpt   =   function   (  next  ,   connection  ,   params  ) {\n       var   rcpt   =   params[  0  ];\n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Got recipient: \"   +   rcpt);\n   \n       // Check user matches regex 'user-YYYYMMDD':\n       var   match   =   /  ^  (  .  *  )-(  \\d  {4}  )(  \\d  {2}  )(  \\d  {2}  )  $  /  .  exec  (rcpt.user);\n       if   (  !  match) {\n           return   next  ();\n       }\n   \n       // get date - note Date constructor takes month-1 (i.e. Dec == 11).\n       var   expiry_date   =   new   Date  (match[  2  ], match[  3  ]  -  1  , match[  4  ]);\n   \n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Email expires on: \"   +   expiry_date);\n       \n       var   today   =   new   Date  ();\n       \n       if   (expiry_date   \u003C   today) {\n           // If we get here, the email address has expired\n           return   next  (  DENY  ,   \"Expired email address\"  );\n       }\n       \n       next  ();\n   }\n  And we can easily check that with swaks (remember to restart Haraka):     swaks   -h   foo.com   -t   booya-20110101@haraka.local   -f   somewhere@example.com   \\\n     -s   localhost   -p   25\n   ===   Trying   localhost:25...\n   ===   Connected   to   localhost.\n   \u003C  -  220 sergeant.org ESMTP Haraka 0.3 ready\n    -  >   EHLO   foo.com\n   \u003C  -  250-Haraka says hi Unknown [127.0.0.1]\n   \u003C  -  250-PIPELINING\n   \u003C  -  250-8BITMIME\n   \u003C  -  250 SIZE 500000\n    -  >   MAIL   FROM:  \u003C  somewhere@example.co  m  >\n   \u003C  -  250 From address is OK\n    -  >   RCPT   TO:  \u003C  booya-20110101@haraka.loca  l  >\n   \u003C**   550 Expired email address\n    -  >   QUIT\n   \u003C  -  221 closing connection. Have a jolly good day.\n   ===   Connection   closed   with   remote   host.\n  Now we need to do one more thing...  Fixing Up Unexpired Emails  The last thing we need to do, is if we have an email that isn't expired, we\nneed to normalise it back to the real email address, because wherever we\ndeliver this to is unlikely to recognise these new email addresses.  Here's how our final plugin will look:     exports  .  hook_rcpt   =   function   (  next  ,   connection  ,   params  ) {\n       var   rcpt   =   params[  0  ];\n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Got recipient: \"   +   rcpt);\n   \n       // Check user matches regex 'user-YYYYMMDD':\n       var   match   =   /  ^  (  .  *  )-(  \\d  {4}  )(  \\d  {2}  )(  \\d  {2}  )  $  /  .  exec  (rcpt.user);\n       if   (  !  match) {\n           return   next  ();\n       }\n   \n       // get date - note Date constructor takes month-1 (i.e. Dec == 11).\n       var   expiry_date   =   new   Date  (match[  2  ], match[  3  ]  -  1  , match[  4  ]);\n   \n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Email expires on: \"   +   expiry_date);\n   \n       var   today   =   new   Date  ();\n   \n       if   (expiry_date   \u003C   today) {\n           // If we get here, the email address has expired\n           return   next  (  DENY  ,   \"Expired email address\"  );\n       }\n       \n       // now get rid of the extension:\n       rcpt.user   =   match[  1  ];\n       this  .  loginfo  (  \"Email address now: \"   +   rcpt);\n       \n       next  ();\n   }\n  And when we test this with an unexpired address via swaks:     swaks   -h   foo.com   -t   booya-20120101@haraka.local   \\\n         -f   somewhere@example.com   -s   localhost   -p   25\n  We get in the logs:   [INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Got recipient: \u003Cbooya-20120101@haraka.local>\n[INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Email expires on: Sun Jan 01 2012 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST)\n[INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Email address now: \u003Cbooya@haraka.local>\n  Which indicates that we have successfully modified the email address.  Further Reading  There are many more features of the Haraka API to explore, including access\nto the body of the email and the headers, access to the HELO string, and\nimplementing ESMTP extensions, among many others.  There are two good places to read up on these. Firstly is the documentation\nin the Haraka \"docs\" directory. Start with the   Plugins.md  file, and work\nyour way through the API from there.  The second place is simply reading the source code for the plugins themselves.\nThe plugins that Haraka ships with use almost all parts of the API and so\nshould give you a good starting point if you want to implement a particular\npiece of functionality. Even the most complicated plugins are under 200 lines\nof code, so don't be intimidated by them!

All aliases are specified in\na JSON formatted configuration file, and must have at very least an action.\nAny syntax error found in the JSON format config file will stop the server\nfrom running.  IMPORTANT: this plugin must appear in   config/plugins  before other plugins\nthat run on hook_rcpt  WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN WITH queue/smtp_proxy.  Configuration   aliases  JSON formatted configuration file that must contain, at very least, a key\nto match against RCPT address, and a value that is an associative array\nwith an \"action\" : \"  \" key, value pair.  An example:     { \"test1\" : { \"action\" : \"drop\" } } \n  In the above example the \"test1\" alias will drop any message that matches\ntest1, or test1-* or test1+* (wildcard '-' or '+', see below).  Actions\nmay in turn have 0 or more options listed with them like so:     { \"test3\" : { \"action\" : \"alias\", \"to\" : \"test3-works\" } }\n  In the above example the \"test3\" alias has an action of \"alias\", and\na required \"to\" field.  If this \"to\" field were missing the alias would\nfail to run, and an error would be printed in the logs.  Now aliases of 'user', '@host' and 'user@host' possible:     { \"demo\" : { \"action\" : \"drop\" } }\n  or\n  { \"@example.com\" : { \"action\" : \"drop\" } } \n  or\n  { \"demo@example.com\" : { \"action\" : \"drop\" } } \n  Aliases may also be exploded to multiple recipients:     { \"sales@example.com\": { \"action\": \"alias\", \"to\": [\"alice@example.com\", \"bob@example.com\"] } }\n   wildcard notation  In an effort to match some of the functionality of other alias parsers\nwe've allowed wildcard matching of the alias against the right most\nstring of a RCPT address.  The characters '-' and '+' are commonly used\nfor subaddressing and this plugin has built-in support to alias the\n\"user\" part of the email address.  That is, if our address were   test2-testing@example.com  (or\n  test2+testing@example.com ), the below alias would match:     { \"test2\" : { \"action\" : \"drop\" } }\n  The larger, and more specific alias, should always match first when\nusing wildcard '-' notation.  So if the above RCPT were put up against\nthis alias config, it would not drop, but rather map to another\naddress:     {\n      \"test2\" : { \"action\" : \"drop\" },\n      \"test2-testing\" : { \"action\" : \"alias\", \"to\" : \"test@foo.com\" }\n  }\n  chaining and circuits  In short, we do not allow chaining of aliases at this time.  As a\nside-effect, we enjoy protections against alias circuits.  optional one line formatting  Any valid JSON will due, however, please consider keeping each alias\non its own line so that others that wish to grep the aliases file\nhave an easier time finding the full configuration for an alias.  nondeterministic duplicate matches  This plugin was written with speed in mind.  That means every lookup\nhashes into the alias file for its match.  While the act of doing so\nis fast, it does mean that any duplicate alias entries will match\nnondeterministically.  That is, we cannot predict what will happen\nhere:     {\n      \"coinflip\" : { \"action\" : \"alias\", \"to\" : \"heads@coin.com\" },\n      \"coinflip\" : { \"action\" : \"alias\", \"to\" : \"tails@coin.com\" }\n  }\n  Truth be told, one result will likely always be chosen over the other,\nso this is not exactly a coinflip.  We simply cannot say what the\nlanguage implementation will do here, it could change tomorrow.  action (required)  The following is a list of supported actions, and the options they require.   drop  This action simply drops a message, while pretending everything was\nokay to the sender.  This acts much like an alias to /dev/null in\nother servers.  alias  This action will map the alias key to the address specified in the\n\"to\" option.  A note about matching in addition to the note\nabout wildcard '-' above.  When we match an alias, we store the\nhostname of the match for a shortcut substitution syntax later.   to (required)  This option is the full address, or local part at matched hostname\nthat the RCPT address will be re-written to.  For an example of\nan alias to a full address consider the following:     { \"test5\" : { \"action\" : \"alias\", \"to\" : \"test5@foo.com\" } }\n  This will map RCPT matches for \"test5\" to \"  test5-works@foo.com \".\nThis would map \"  test5@somedomain.com \" to \"  test5-works@foo.com \"\nevery time.  Now compare this notation with its shortcut\ncounterpart, best used when the \"to\" address is at the same\ndomain as the match:     { \"test4\" : { \"action\" : \"alias\", \"to\" : \"test4\" } }\n  Clearly, this notation is more compact, but what does it do.  Well,\nmail to \"  test4-foo@anydomain.com \" will map to \"  test4@anydomain.com \".\nOne can see the clear benefit of using this notation with lots of\naliases on a single domain that map to other local parts at the\nsame domain.

HOW IT WORKS  From Wikipedia:   Forward Confirmed Reverse DNS   First a reverse DNS lookup (PTR query) is performed on the IP address,\nwhich returns a list of zero or more PTR records.  For each domain name returned in the PTR query results, a regular\n'forward' DNS lookup (type A or AAAA query) is then performed.  Any A or AAAA records returned by the second query are then compared\nagainst the original IP address. If there is a match, FCrDNS passes.  iprev  The iprev results are added to the Authentication-Results header.   RFC 1912  RFC 5451  RFC 7001  2.6.3.  \"iprev\" Results  pass:  The DNS evaluation succeeded, i.e., the \"reverse\" and\n\"forward\" lookup results were returned and were in agreement.  fail:  The DNS evaluation failed.  In particular, the \"reverse\" and\n\"forward\" lookups each produced results, but they were not in\nagreement, or the \"forward\" query completed but produced no\nresult, e.g., a DNS RCODE of 3, commonly known as NXDOMAIN, or an\nRCODE of 0 (NOERROR) in a reply containing no answers, was\nreturned.  temperror:  The DNS evaluation could not be completed due to some\nerror that is likely transient in nature, such as a temporary DNS\nerror, e.g., a DNS RCODE of 2, commonly known as SERVFAIL, or\nother error condition resulted.  A later attempt may produce a\nfinal result.  permerror:  The DNS evaluation could not be completed because no PTR\ndata are published for the connecting IP address, e.g., a DNS\nRCODE of 3, commonly known as NXDOMAIN, or an RCODE of 0 (NOERROR)\nin a reply containing no answers, was returned.  This prevented\ncompletion of the evaluation.  A later attempt is unlikely to\nproduce a final result.",{"id":341,"path":342,"dir":218,"title":343,"description":344,"keywords":345,"body":346},"content:8.plugins:connect.geoip.md","/plugins/connect.geoip","geoip - GeoIP lookup","Haraka geoip plugin - GeoIP lookup",[],"  geoip plugin  provide geographic information about mail senders.  SYNOPSIS  Use MaxMind's GeoIP databases to report geographic information about senders. This plugin has support for both the   maxmind  and   geoip-lite  node modules.  INSTALL  Install the npm geoip module you prefer:   npm install maxmind\n  or\nnpm install -g geoip-lite\n  If both are installed, maxmind will be preferred as it's faster and also provides ASN data. The maxmind module requires manual download of the GeoIP databases. The npm module   maxmind-geolite-mirror  will download the files and keep them up-to-date if you run it periodically.     mkdir   -p   /usr/local/share/GeoIP\n   npm   install   -g   maxmind-geolite-mirror\n   /usr/local/bin/maxmind-geolite-mirror\n  DESCRIPTION  GeoIP results are stored in connection.notes.geoip and connection.  results  .connect.geoip. The following information is typically available:   continent: NA,\ncountry:   US,\n  If the GeoIP city database is available, the following may also be available:   region:   CA,\ncity:     San Francisco,\nll:       [37.7484, -122.4156],\ndistance: 1539    // in kilometers\nrange:    [ 3479299040, 3479299071 ],\n   connect.geoip  also adds entries like this to your logs:   [connect.geoip] US\n[connect.geoip] US, WA\n[connect.geoip] US, WA, Seattle\n[connect.geoip] US, WA, Seattle, 1319km\n  Calculating the distance requires the public IP of this mail server. This may\nbe the IP that Haraka is bound to. If not, make sure that   utils.get_public_ip \ncan figure it out (via STUN or in   smtp.ini ).  CONFIG   distance  Perform the geodesic distance calculations. Calculates the distance \"as the\ncrow flies\" from the remote mail server.  This calculation requires a 'from' IP address. This will typically be the\npublic IP of your mail server. If Haraka is bound to a private IP, net_utils\nwill attempt to determine your public IP. If that doesn't work, edit\nconfig/smtp.ini and set   public_ip .   show_city  show city data in logs and headers. City data is less accurate than country.   show_region in logs and headers. Regional data are US states, Canadian\nprovinces and such.  Set a connection result to true if the distance exceeds this many kilometers.   too_far=4000   asn report_as  Permits reporting the ASN as another plugin (such as connect.asn).  SPAM PREDICTION WITH DISTANCE   Spatio-temporal Network-level Automatic Reputation Engine   \"For ham, 90% of the messages travel about 4,000 km or less. On the\nother hand, for spam, only 28% of messages stay within this range.\"\n  Observations in 2014 suggest that geodesic distance continues to be an\nexcellent predictor of spam.  LIMITATIONS  The distance calculations are more concerned with being fast than\naccurate. The MaxMind location data is collected from whois and is of\nlimited accuracy. MaxMind offers more accurate data for a fee.  For distance calculations, the earth is considered a perfect sphere. In\nreality, it is not. Accuracy should be within 1%.  This plugin does not update the GeoIP databases. You may want to.

The records in   dns  are ready to be copy/pasted into the DNS\nzone for example.org.  The DKIM DNS record will look like this:   may2013._domainkey TXT \"v=DKIM1;p=[public key stripped of whitespace];\"\n  And the values in the address have the following meaning:   hash: h=[ sha1 | sha256 ]\ntest; t=[ s | s:y ]\ngranularity: g=[ ]\nnotes: n=[ ]\nservices: s=[email]\nkeytypes: [ rsa ]\n  Key size  The default key size created by   dkim_key_gen.sh  is 2048. As of mid-2014, there are some DNS providers that do not support key sizes that long.  What to sign  The DKIM signing key for messages from example.org   should  be signed with\na DKIM key for example.org.

Principles of work  Notation  The so-called   tuple  consists of the following:   First subdomain of rDNS is stripped off (but no shorter than the domain boundary). This is considered a   hostid .  Envelope sender is the   sender .  RCPT TO would supply the   recipient .   hostid  in above notation is chosen unless:   The connecting host has no PTR record, a.k.a. reverse DNS (rDNS).   gl  The rDNS record contains the first two or last two octets of the IP address.   fcrdns  The rDNS record contains the ‘short’, decimal, or hex representation of the full IP address.   fcrdns    gl  Multiple rDNS records are returned.   gl  The rDNS record cannot be verified by forward confirmation (e.g. FCrDNS).   fcrdns  The top-level-domain (TLD) used is not valid.   gl  In other cases, it's set to be the remote party's IP address.  We define the following time periods:    black :  between first connect and start of   gray . Defer.   gray :   between   black  and start of   white . Allow. Host must re-try within this window.   white :  comes after   gray . Allow up until the end of period, then let the record expire in case no connections were made.  Algorithm  The greylist algo is as following:   Party connects. All FcrDNS & DNSWL checks are run by earlier plugins.  Party sends   recipient   If not already whitelisted\n   Check   tuple  color (compare current TS against record creation TS)\n    black ?\n   Create if no record exists. Defer.   gray ?\n   Allow.

Connections scoring in excess of specified thresholds are rewarded or   penalized  in proportionate ways.  Description  Haraka includes some excellent plugins that detect message or sender patterns that are indicative of spam.   Some    plugins    have    accuracy  rates above 95%. Detecting messages incorrectly 5% of the time means that some portion of ham will get blocked and some portion of spam will get delivered. The traditional solution is to permit users to specify their filtering aggressiveness, and then suffer the consequences (blocked ham -vs- too much spam).  By scoring and weighting several \"95+\" plugins, accuracy rates above 99% are attainable. With a half dozen such plugins,   99.99% accuracy  is attainable. With karma, good senders with good history can occasionally fail tests (false positives) and still deliver their mail. Senders with poor history will have a much harder time.  Karma Prereqs  One challenge for mail filtering is that filters (or plugins, in Haraka's case) are usually called in sequence. A message passes from one filter to the next in a pipeline and each filter gets to choose \"yeah or nay.\" In order for karma to transcend this limit, karma requires that   every  filter passes every message. Nearly all Haraka plugins have a   reject  or   deny  option for this reason.  In order to score a filters results, filters must save their results to the   Result Store . Karma will see that and apply the award specified in   karma.ini .  How Karma Works  Karma takes a holistic view of   connections . During the connection, karma collects these results and applies the   result_awards  defined in   karma.ini . Once a connection/message exceeds the threshold.negative score (default: -8), karma rejects it at the next   deny hook.  The scoring mechanism is not dissimilar to   SpamAssassin , but Karma has some particular advantages:   * Runs entirely in Node, so it's very fast\n* Async and very scalable.\n* Builds sender and network reputation databases\n* Has access to connection properties (relaying, port, auth attempts, etc..)\n* Access to raw SMTP commands (data + formatting inspection)\n* Can reject connections before DATA (save lots of bandwidth)\n  Karma is not a replacement for content filters. Karma focuses on the quality of the   connection . Content filters (bayes*) focus on the content of the   message . Karma works best   with  content filters.  CONFIG  See config/karma.ini for options and inline documentation.  AWARDS  Karma allows the site administrator to control how much weight to assign to\nplugin results, providing a great deal of control over what results are\nworth rejecting for.  Karma begins scoring the connection when the first packet arrives. The IP reputation,   sender OS ,   GeoIP location ,   DNSBL  listing, and   FCrDNS  are often a sufficient basis for rejecting a connection without ever blocking a ham.  Karma performs checks early and often, maximizing the penality it can exact upon bad mailers.  Penalties  Deny / Reject  When connections become worse than   thresholds negative, they are denied during the next   deny hook.  History  Karma history is computed as the number of good - bad connections.  When each connection ends,   karma  records the result. When a sufficient history has been built for an IP or ASN, future connections from that address(es) will get a positive or negative karma award.  The reward is purposefully small, to permit good senders in bad neighborhoods to still send.  Connection Delays  Connection delays (aka tarpitting, teergrubing, early talker) slow down a SMTP conversation by inserting artificial delays. Karma increases connection delays adaptively as connection quality changes.  Karma's delay goals:   1. Don't delay valid senders\n2. Penalize senders in proportion to their karma score\n3. Dampen bruteforce AUTH attacks.\n4. Since the only *cost* we can exact from miscreants is time, and connections are cheap to maintain, keep miscreants online as long as possible.\n  There are three tarpit options:   [tarpit]\n* delay=0   (seconds to delay,      default: 0)\n* max=5     (max seconds to delay,  default: 5)\n  When set to zero, the value of the delay is adaptive, calculated proportional\nto the karma score of the connection. Connections with good karma will see no\ndelay and bad ones will see long delays.  When delay is non-zero, each SMTP response will be delayed by that many seconds.  In practice, most naughty senders abandon the connection when forced to\nwait more than a handful of seconds.   max  sets the maximum delay between\nresponses.  When using   karma , do not use Haraka's   tarpit  plugin.  Included Tests  Connection data that karma considers:    IP Reputation   ASN reputation  DENY events by other plugins  envelope sender from a spammy TLD   malformed envelope addresses   unrecognized SMTP commands  matching   env from  and   env to  name (rare in ham, frequent in spam)  The data from these tests are helpful but the real power of karma is   scoring\nthe results  of other plugins. See karma.ini for a rich set of examples.   IP Reputation  Karma records the number of good, bad, and total connections.  The results\nare accessible to other plugins as well.   var karma = connection.results.get('karma');\n  The karma result object contains at least the following:   score: 0,         \u003C- score for this connection\nhistory: 0,       \u003C- score for all connections\n   good: 0,       \u003C- qty of past 'good' connections\n   bad: 0,        \u003C- qty of past 'bad' connections\nconnections: 0,   \u003C- total past connections\npass: [],         \u003C- tests that added positive karma\nfail: [],         \u003C- tests that added negative karma\n  If an IP has at least 5 connections and all are good or bad, and   all_good  or\n  all_bad  result will be added to the   pass  or   fail  test list. This are\nvery good indicators of future connection quality and are scored in karma.ini.   ASN / Network Neighborhood Reputation   [asn]\nenable=true    (default: true)\nreport_as\n  When   asn enable is true, karma records the number of good and bad\nconnections from each ASN.  ASNs with less than 5 karma points in either direction are ignored.  report_as  Store the ASN results as another plugin. Example: I set   report_as=asn , so that karma history for an ASN is reported with the ASN plugin data. A practical consequence of changing report_as is that the award location in karma.ini would need to change from:   NNN karma | pass | equals | asn_all_good |  2\nNNN karma | fail | equals | asn_all_bad  | -3\n  to:   NNN asn | pass | equals | asn_all_good |  2\nNNN asn | fail | equals | asn_all_bad  | -3\n   Malformed Envelope Addresses  Very old versions of Outlook Express and some malware senders don't bother complying with the RFC (5321, 2821, 821) address format. Karma checks the envelope from and to addresses for a common RFC ignorant pattern that is highly correlated with malware.   Unrecognized SMTP verbs/commands  Certain bruteforce password hacking tools have a pre-programmed SMTP path\nthat ignores SMTP responses. After EHLO, they attempt AUTH,LOGIN with a valid\nusername. To bruteforce a password often requires millions of attempts so each\nbot sprays a couple dozen connections at the target server. Better quality\nMTAs like Haraka have built-in auth protection that inserts timeouts\nbetween successive auth attempts. The bots work around that by dropping the\nconnection after each failure and reconnecting. The attempts are distributed\nso IP blocking is of limited effectiveness.  To combat these bruteforce attacks several strategies are called for:   1. Impose [connection delays](#delay)\n2. Disable SMTP-AUTH when not encrypted. The bots rarely use STARTTLS.\n   Besides preventing user passwords from transiting the internet in clear\n   text, requiring TLS encryption also means AUTH is not available to\n   poorly written bots.\n3. Having done #2, bot AUTH attempts show up as unrecognized commands.\n   Penalizing these with tarpitting and rate limiting will almost never\n   harm a legit sender but it will make it take much much longer for\n   attackers to bruteforce passwords.\n  LIMITATIONS  Karma is most effective at filtering mail delivered by bots and rogue servers.\nSpam delivered by servers with good reputations normally pass karma's checks.\nExpect to use karma   with  content filters.",{"id":494,"path":495,"dir":218,"title":496,"description":497,"keywords":498,"body":505},"content:8.plugins:limit.md","/plugins/limit","limit - Limits plugin for Haraka","Haraka limit plugin - Limits the number of messages per connection",[499,500,501,502,503,504],"concurrency","recipients","unrecognized_commands","errors","Too high counters","Too low counters","  limit plugin  Apply several types of limits to SMTP connections.  Each limit type has a max value that can be defined in limit.ini. The default is empty / disabled until a value has been set.  concurrency  When   [concurrency]max  is defined, it limits the maximum number of simultaneous connections per IP address. Connection attempts in excess of the limit are delayed for   disconnect_delay  seconds (default: 3) before being disconnected.  This works best in conjunction with a history / reputation database, so that\none can assign very low concurrency (1) to bad or unknown senders and higher\nlimits for reputable mail servers.  History  History: when enabled, the   history  setting is the name of a plugin that stores IP history / reputation results. The result store must have a positive value for good connections and negative integers for poor / undesirable connections. Karma is one such plugin.  recipients  When   [recipients]max  is defined, each connection is limited to that number of recipients. The limit is imposed against   all  recipient attempts. Attempts in excess of the limit are issued a temporary failure.  unrecognized_commands  When   [unrecognized_commands]max  is set, a connection that exceeeds the limit is disconnected.  Unrecognized commands are normally SMTP verbs invalidly issued by the client.\nExamples:   issuing AUTH when we didn't advertise AUTH extension  issuing STARTTLS when we didn't advertise STARTTLS  invalid SMTP verbs  Limitations  The unrecognized_command hook is used by the   tls  and   auth  plugins, so\nrunning this plugin before those would result in valid operations getting\ncounted against that connections limits. The solution is simple: list\n  limit  in config/plugins after those.  errors  When   [errors]max  is set, a connection that exceeeds the limit is disconnected. Errors that count against this limit include:   issuing commands out of turn (MAIL before EHLO, RCPT before MAIL, etc)  attempting MAIL on port 465/587 without AUTH  MAIL or RCPT addresses that fail to parse  Error Handling  Too high counters  If the NoSQL store is Redis and Haraka is restarted or crashes while active\nconnections are open, the concurrency counters might be inflated. This is\nhandled by the   concurrency reset setting (default: 10m), which:   ssc: sets collection expiration time  redis: empties the concurrency hash  RAM: empties the in-memory hash of all keys  Too low counters  Because the redis and RAM objects are emptied periodically, connections that\nare open while the collections are emptied will be too low.

Errors  The elasticsearch module has very robust error handling built in.

Installation  Install the SNF Client/Server package for your platform as per the instructions on the MessageSniffer website.  Modify your SNFServer.xml file and under the 'xheaders' section set:   output mode='api'  This prevents MessageSniffer from adding additional headers to the temporary file used to send it the message data which is\nunnecessary as Haraka reads the headers from the XCI response.   rulebase on-off='on'  result on-off='on'  black on-off='on'  while on-off='on'  clean on-off='on'  all symbol on-off='on'  These cause SNFServer to send Haraka additional headers that are inserted into all messages scanned by MessageSniffer and\nwill aid debugging and troubleshooting.  Once this is done start/restart the SNF server.  Configuration  This plugin uses   messagesniffer.ini  for configuration.  The   [main]  section is for global configuration, the   [gbudb] \nsection is used to specify the action that should be taken based on the GBUdb result which is checked at the start of the\nconnection and the   [message]  section is used to specify the action to be taken based on the main scan result.

It uses the 'queue' hook, so that it runs after all the 'data_post' plugins\nand should be listed in 'config/plugins' to run before your queue hooks that\nperform actual deliveries.  To ensure that only completely written files are present in the quarantine,\nthe files are written to a temporary directory first and then hardlinked to\nthe final destination before the temporary file is deleted.  The temporary directory is 'quarantine_path/tmp' which defaults to:\n/var/spool/haraka/quarantine/tmp.

This is a common setup when you\nwant to have a mail server with a solid pedigree of outbound delivery to\nother hosts, and inbound delivery to users.  In comparison to   queue/smtp_proxy , this plugin waits until queue time to\nattempt the ongoing connection. This can be a benefit in reducing connections\nto your inbound mail server when you have content filtering (such as\nspamassassin) enabled. A possible downside is that it also delays recipient\nvalidation that the ongoing mail server may provide until queue time.  Configuration   smtp_forward.ini  Configuration is stored in this file in the following keys:   enable_outbound=  true  SMTP forward outbound messages (set to false to enable Haraka's separate\nOutbound mail routing (MX based delivery)).  host=HOST  The host to connect to.  port=PORT  The port to connect to. Default: 25  connect_timeout=SECONDS  The maximum amount of time to wait when creating a new connection\nto the host.  Default: 30 seconds.  timeout=SECONDS  The amount of seconds to let a backend connection live idle in the\nconnection pool.  This should always be less than the global plugin\ntimeout, which should in turn be less than the connection timeout.  max_connections=NUMBER  Maximum number of connections at any given time. Default: 1000  enable_tls=  true  Enable TLS with the forward host (if supported). TLS uses options\nfrom the tls plugin. If key and cert are provided in the the outbound section of the tls plugin,\nthat certificate will be used as a TLS Client Certificate.  This option controls the use of TLS via   STARTTLS . This plugin does not work with\nSMTP over TLS.  auth_type=  plain|login  Enable PLAIN or LOGIN SMTP AUTH.  This is required to enable AUTH.  auth_user=USERNAME  SMTP AUTH username to use.  auth_pass=PASSWORD  SMTP AUTH password to use.  queue  Which queue plugin to use. Default: undefined. The default bahavior is to\nuse smtp_forward for inbound connections and outbound for relaying\nconnections. This option is used for complex mail routes.  check_sender=false  Requires that sender domains defined in smtp_forward.ini (see Per-Domain below) have relaying privileges. This is a form of spoof prevention and assumes that any mail clients have relaying or AUTH privileges. This is usually the case.  check_recipient=false  By default, Haraka accepts no emails until a recipient plugin has been configured to accept mails for a domain. The simplest common case is the in_host_list plugin with a list of domains in config/host_list. An alternative is to set   check_recipient=true  and list each domain in a definition block in smtp_forward.ini (see Per-Domain Configuration). An example for two domains:   example.com  example.net  Per-Domain Configuration  More specific forward routes for domains can be defined. The domain is\nchosen based on the value of the   domain_selector  config variable.  When   domain_selector  is set to   rcpt_to  (the default), more specific\nroutes are only honored for SMTP connections with a single recipient or SMTP\nconnections where every recipient host is identical.  When   domain_selector  is set to   mail_from , the domain of the MAIL FROM\naddress is used.  enable_outbound can be set or unset on a per-domain level to enable or disable\nforwarding for specific domains.     # default SMTP host\n   host  =1.2.3.4\n   # auth_type=plain\n   # auth_user=user\n   # auth_user=pass\n   \n   [example1.com]\n   host  =1.2.3.5\n   # auth_type=plain\n   # auth_user=user\n   # auth_pass=pass\n   \n   [example2.com]\n   host  =1.2.3.5\n   \n   [example3.com]\n   host  =1.2.3.6\n   \n   [example4.com]\n   enable\\  _outbound  =false\n  Split host forward routing  When an incoming email transaction has multiple recipients with different forward routes,  recipients to subsequent forward routes are deferred. Example: an incoming email transaction has recipients   user@example1.com ,   user@example2.com , and   user@example3.com . The first two recipients will be accepted (they share the same forward destination) and the latter will be deferred. It will arrive in a future delivery attempt by the remote.  html .dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html.dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}",{"id":638,"path":639,"dir":575,"title":640,"description":641,"keywords":642,"body":643},"content:8.plugins:queue:smtp_proxy.md","/plugins/queue/smtp_proxy","queue/smtp_proxy - Deliver mail to the proxy MTA","Haraka queue/smtp_proxy plugin - Deliver mail to the proxy MTA",[229],"  queue/smtp_proxy plugin  This plugin delivers to another mail server.

In Haraka, the   rcpt_to.*  plugins usually decide which domains and/or email addresses are deliverable. By default, everything else is rejected.   Relaying  is when a MTA accepts mail that is destined elsewhere. Back in the day (1980s), most MTAs permitted open relaying. Soon spammers abused our open relays (1990s) and left us with soiled mail queues. Now nearly all MTAs have relaying disabled and   MUAs  are required to use a   MSA  to relay. Most MTAs (including Haraka) have MSA features and can serve both purposes.  This   relay  plugin provides Haraka with options for managing relay permissions.  Authentication  One way to enable relaying is   authentication  via the auth plugins. Successful authentication enables relaying during   that  SMTP connection. To securely offer SMTP AUTH, the   tls  plugin and at least one auth plugin must be enabled and properly configured. When that requirement is met, the AUTH SMTP extension will be advertised to SMTP clients.   % nc mail.example.com 587\n220 mail.example.com ESMTP Haraka 2.4.0 ready\nehlo client.example.com\n250-mail.example.com Hello client.example.com [192.168.0.1], Haraka is at your service.\n250-PIPELINING\n250-8BITMIME\n250-SIZE 10000000\n250 STARTTLS\nquit\n221 mail.example.com closing connection.

Have a jolly good day.\n   closed\n  To avoid port 25 restrictions, in 1998 we developed   SMTP submission  on port 587. As of January 2018,   RFC 8314  resurrects   SMTPS  on port 465 in favor of port 587 with STARTTLS. For optimal security and reliability,   MUAs  should be configured to send mail to port 465 with TLS.  ACL (Access Control List)  ACL processing is enabled by setting acl=true in the   relay  section of\nrelay.ini:   [relay]\nacl=true\n  With the Access Control List feature, relaying can be enabled for IPv4 and\nIPv6 networks. IP ranges listed in the ACL file are allowed to send mails\nwithout furthur checks.    config/relay_acl_allow  Allowed IP ranges in CIDR notation, one per line.  Back in the day, ISPs enabled all of their IP space to relay. That proved\nproblematic for users who took their laptops and mobile phones elsewhere and\nthen couldn't send mail. For end users therefore, use SMTP AUTH described\nabove. If you reside somewhere technology evolves more slowly, you can still\nadd IP allocations to   relay_acl_allow  like so:   echo 'N.N.N.N/24' >> /path/to/haraka/config/relay_acl_allow\n  A common use case for IP based relaying is to relay messages on behalf of\nanother mail server. If your organization has an Exchange server, using Haraka\nto filter inbound messages is a great choice. You might also want to relay\noutbound messages via Haraka as well, so they can be DKIM signed on their way\nto the internet. For such a use case, you would set 'acl=true' (the default)\nin the   relay  section of   relay.ini  and then add the external IP address\nof the corporate firewall to   config/relay_acl_allow :   echo 'N.N.N.N/32' >> /path/to/haraka/config/relay_acl_allow\n  Force Route / Dest  ination  Domains  Force routes and Destination Domains are enabled by setting in the   relay \nsection of relay.ini:   [relay]\nforce_routing=false  (default: false)\ndest_domains=false   (default: false)\n  These two features share another common config file:    config/relay_dest_domains.ini  The format is ini and entries are within the   domains  section. The key for each entry is the domain and the value is a JSON string. Within the JSON string, the currently supported keys are:   * action  (Dest Domains)\n* nexthop (Force Route)\n  Force Route  Think of force route as the equivalent of the transport map in Postfix or the smtproutes file in Qmail. Rather than looking up the MX for a host, the   nexthop  value from the entry in the config file is used.  The value of \"nexthop\": can be a hostname or an IP, optionally follow by   .  Example:   [domains]\ntest.com = { \"action\": \"continue\", \"nexthop\": \"127.0.0.1:2525\" }\n  Destination Domains  Allowed destination/recipient domains. The field within the JSON value used\nby Dest Domains is \"action\": and the possible values are accept, continue, or\ndeny.   * accept   (accept the mail without further checks)\n  Example:   [domains]\ntest.com = { \"action\": \"accept\" }\n  I think of   accept  as the equivalent of qmail's   rcpthosts , or a misplaced Haraka   rcpt_to.*  plugin. The   accept  mechanism is another way to tell Haraka that a particular domain is one we accept mail for. The difference between this and the   rcpt_to.in_host_list  plugin is that this one also enables relaying.   * continue (mails are subject to further checks)\n  Example:   [domains]\ntest.com = { \"action\": \"continue\" }\n  Because the default behavior of Dest Routes is to deny, the   continue  option provides an escape, permitting another Haraka plugin to validate the recipient. Like the   accept  option, it too enables relaying.   * deny    (mails are rejected)\n  This deny option baffles me. The default behavior of Haraka is to reject emails for\nwhich a recipient validation plugin hasn't vouched. Adding it here prevents\nany subsequent recipient validation plugin from getting a chance. It also\nnecessitates the continue option.  all  Relay all is enabled by setting all=true in the   relay  section of\nrelay.ini:   [relay]\nall=true     (default: false)\n  Relay all is useful for spamtraps to accept all mail.  Do NOT use this on a real mail server, unless you really know what you are\ndoing.

By default this plugin with only add trace Received-SPF headers to a message.\nTo make it reject mail then you will need to enable the relevant options below.\n  [deny]helo_fail  and   [deny]mfrom_fail  are the closest match for the intent\nof SPF but you will need to whitelist any hosts forwarding mail from another\ndomain whilst preserving the original return-path.  Configuration  This plugin uses spf.ini for configuration and the following options are\navailable:   [relay]\ncontext=sender   (default: sender)\n  On connections with relaying privileges (MSA or mail relay), it is often\ndesirable to evaluate SPF from the context of Haraka's public IP(s), in the\nsame fashion the next mail server will evaluate it when we send to them.\nIn that use case, Haraka should use context=myself.   * context=sender    evaluate SPF based on the sender (connection.remote.ip)\n* context=myself    evaluate SPF based on Haraka's public IP\n  The rest of the optional settings (disabled by default) permit deferring or\ndenying mail from senders whose SPF fails the checks.  Additional settings allow you to control the small things (defaults are shown):     ; The lookup timeout, in seconds. Better set it to something much lower than this.\n   lookup_timeout   = 29\n   \n   ; bypass hosts that match these conditions\n   [skip]\n   ; hosts that relay through us\n   relaying   = false\n   ; hosts that are SMTP AUTH'ed\n   auth   = false\n  There's a special setting that would allow the plugin to emit a funny explanation text on SPF DENY, essentially meant to be visible to end-users that will receive the bounce.

During observation in 2014,\nmore spam senders have valid SPF HELO than ham senders. If you expect very\nlittle from SPF HELO validation, you might still be disappointed.  Enabling error deferrals will cause excessive delays and perhaps bounced\nmail for senders with broken DNS. Enable this only if you are willing to\ndelay and sometimes lose valid mail.  Broken SPF records by valid senders are common. Keep that in mind when\nconsidering denial of SPF error results. If you deny on error, budget\ntime for instructing senders on how to correct their SPF records so they\ncan email you.  The only deny option most sites should consider is   mfrom_fail . That will\nreject messages that explicitely fail SPF tests. SPF failures have a high\ncorrelation with spam. However, up to 10% of ham transits forwarders and/or\nemail lists which frequently break SPF. SPF results are best used as inputs\nto other plugins such as DMARC,   spamassassin , and   karma .

To check the SPF record for a domain:     # spf --ip 1.2.3.4 --domain fsl.com\n   ip  =  1.2.3.4   helo  =  \"\"   domain  =  \"fsl.com\"   result  =  Fail\n  To check the SPF record for a HELO/EHLO name:     # spf --ip 1.2.3.4 --helo foo.bar.com\n   ip  =  1.2.3.4   helo  =  \"foo.bar.com\"   domain  =  \"\"   result  =  None\n  You can add   --debug  to the option arguments to see a full trace of the SPF processing.

Non-absolute paths are relative to the   config/  directory.  To configure a single key and a cert chain, located in the   config/ \ndirectory, use the following in   tls.ini :     key  =example.com.key.pem\n   cert  =example.com.crt-chain.pem\n  To use multiple pairs of key and cert chain files outside of the haraka\n  config/  directory, configure instead:     key[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.rsa.key.pem\n   cert[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.rsa.crt-chain.pem\n   key[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.ecdsa.key.pem\n   cert[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.ecdsa.crt-chain.pem\n  cert  Specifies the location(s) for the certificate chain file. For multiple certificate chains, use   cert[]=  assignment for each. Non-absolute paths are relative to the   config/  directory. See the description of the   key  parameter for specific use.  no_tls_hosts  If needed, add this section to the   config/tls.ini  file and list any IP ranges that have broken TLS hosts. Ex:     [no_tls_hosts]\n   192.168.1.3\n   172.16.0.0/16\n  The   Node.js TLS  page has additional information about the following options.  no_starttls_ports  An array of incoming ports on which Haraka will not advertise STARTTLS capability.     no_starttls_ports[]=2525\n  force_tls_hosts  For known good TLS hosts, it's possible to force that the outbound mailer will only connect via secure sockets. This makes Haraka use   forced TLS  instead of   opportunistic TLS . For forced TLS, the STARTTLS upgrade must succeed with a valid certificate (overriding   rejectUnauthorized ). The list is matched both against the host (MX record or   nexthop  in   relay_dest_domains.ini ), and the domain name of the email address.  Note: unlike   no_tls_hosts , this feature is implemented as an array:     [outbound]\n   force_tls_hosts[]=172.17.123.1\n   force_tls_hosts[]=172.17.124.0/24\n   force_tls_hosts[]=mx.example.org\n   force_tls_hosts[]=example.com\n  ciphers  A list of allowable ciphers to use.

Example:    minVersion=TLSv1.1 \n  If unset, the default is node's tls.DEFAULT_MIN_VERSION constant.  (  Node.js 11.4+ required , for older instances you can use   secureProtocol  settings)  honorCipherOrder  If specified, the list of configured ciphers is treated as the cipher priority from highest to lowest. The first matching cipher will be used, instead of letting the client choose. The default is   true .  ecdhCurve  Specifies the elliptic curve used for ECDH or ECDHE ciphers.\nOnly one curve can be specified. The default is   prime256v1  (NIST P-256).  dhparam  Specifies the file containing the diffie-hellman parameters to use for DH or DHE key exchange. If this param or file is missing, it will be generated automatically. Default:   dhparams.pem .  requestCert  Whether Haraka should request a certificate from a connecting client.   requestCert=[true|false]  (default: true)\n  rejectUnauthorized  Reject connections from clients without a CA validated TLS certificate.   rejectUnauthorized=[true|false]  (default: false)\n  requireAuthorized  When   rejectUnauthorized=false , require validated TLS certificates on just the specified ports.     requireAuthorized[]=465  ;\n   requireAuthorized[]=587  ;\n  secureProtocol  Specifies the OpenSSL API function used for handling the TLS session. Choose\none of the methods described at the\n  OpenSSL API page .\nThe default is   SSLv23_method .  requestOCSP  Specifies that OCSP Stapling should be enabled, according to RFC 6066.\nStapling of OCSP messages allows the client to receive these along the\nTLS session setup instead of delaying the session setup by requiring a\nseparate http connection to the OCSP server.   requestOCSP=[true|false]  (default: false)\n  OCSP responses from the OCSP server are cached in memory for as long as\nthey are valid, and get refreshed after that time. A server restart\nrequires the OCSP responses to be fetched again upon the first client\nconnection.  Inbound Specific Configuration  By default the above options are shared with outbound mail (either\nusing   smtp_forward ,   smtp_proxy  or plain outbound mail heading to\nan external destination). To make these options specific to inbound\nmail, put them under an   [inbound]  parameter group. Outbound options\ncan go under an   [outbound]  parameter group, and plugins that use\nSMTP tls for queueing such as   smtp_proxy  and   smtp_forward  can\nuse that plugin name for plugin specific options.

It was generated by   Haraka , an Internet message transfer agent. Your mailer tried to send an e-mail message to a server running Haraka.\nUnfortunately, Haraka spotted a problem: your mailer sent a bare LF.  Why should I worry about bare LFs?  You can't get mail through to msn.com and thousands of other systems around the Internet. Your mailer is violating 822bis section 2.3, which specifically prohibits all bare LFs.  How can my mailer be fixed?  That depends on what software you're using.   Solaris 2.5 sendmail: \nUpgrade!\nFixed in Solaris 2.5.1.\nYou can fix the problem by putting ``,E=\\r\\n''\nat the end of Mether, Mtcp, or Msmtp in sendmail.cf.\n(Note that Mether is not the same as DMether.)  sendmail V8 has a bug that will produce a bare LF in certain messages (e.g., messages with very long lines). This bug was identified in November 1996; I don't know if it has been fixed yet.   Eudora Pro 4.0 for Windows: \nUpgrade!\nThe HTML LF problem was fixed in 4.0.1.\nThe attachment LF problem was fixed in 4.1.   listproc 6.0c: \nChuck Foster says you should add   CONVERT(buf);'' before  WRITE_TO_SOCKET'' around line 165 of sysmail.c\nin the Listproc source code.   fetchmail: \nUpgrade!\nRecent versions of fetchmail reportedly do the right thing.\nMake sure the forcecr option is on.   Galacticom WorldGroups: \nReported 19970716. No information yet on how it can be fixed.   Claris Emailer: \nReported 19980613. No information yet on how it can be fixed.  What is a bare LF, anyway?  It is an ASCII linefeed (LF) character not preceded by an ASCII carriage-return (CR) character.\nEvery line in an Internet mail message is required to end with CR LF. The entire message ends with CR LF dot CR LF.  822bis specifically prohibits other uses of LF.\nThe mail clients discussed above are incorrectly ending lines with LF and, in most cases, ending the entire message with LF dot LF.\nThat's not CR LF dot CR LF, so a server such as msn.com will sit there waiting for the rest of the message. After a while it'll give up and drop the connection.\nYour mail doesn't get through.  Some mail servers convert a bare LF into CR LF, and accept LF dot LF as the end of a mail message. This behavior is specifically prohibited by 821bis (and RFC 2821).  This document was taken from   http://cr.yp.to/docs/smtplf.html",1729949628649]
