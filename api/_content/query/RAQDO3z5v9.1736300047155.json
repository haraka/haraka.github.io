The process is simple - if a plugin in Haraka tells\nthe internals that this mail is to be relayed, then it gets queued in the\n\"queue\" directory for delivery. Then it will go through several delivery\nattempts until it is either successful or fails hard for some reason. A\nhard failure will result in a bounce email being sent to the \"MAIL FROM\"\naddress used when connecting to Haraka. If that address also bounces then\nit is considered a \"double bounce\" and Haraka will log an error and drop it\non the floor."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"the-setup"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Setup"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Outbound mail servers should run on port 587 and enforce authentication.
