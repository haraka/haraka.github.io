# auth/auth_vpopmaild plugin

The `auth/vpopmaild` plugin allows you to authenticate against a vpopmaild
daemon.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `config/auth_vpopmaild.ini` and uses INI
style formatting.

There are three configuration settings:

* host: The host/IP that vpopmaild is listening on (default: localhost).

* port: The TCP port that vpopmaild is listening on (default: 89).

* sysadmin: A colon separated username:password of a vpopmail user with
    SYSADMIN privileges (see vpopmail/bin/vmoduser -S). This is **only**
    necessary to support CRAM-MD5 which requires access to the clear text
    password. On new installs, it's best not to use CRAM-MD5, as it requires
    storing clear text passwords. Legacy clients with MUAs configured
    to authenticate with CRAM-MD5 will need this enabled.


### Per-domain Configuration

Additionally, domains can each have their own configuration for connecting
to vpopmaild. The defaults are the same, so only the differences needs to
be declared. Example:

    [example.com]
    host=192.168.0.1
    port=999

    [example2.com]
    host=192.168.0.2
    sysadmin=postmaster@example2.com:sekret
