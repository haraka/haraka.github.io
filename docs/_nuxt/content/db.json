Haraka can serve thousands of concurrent connections\nand deliver thousands of messages per second. Haraka and plugins are written\nin asynchronous JS and are very fast.\n\nHaraka has very good spam protection (see [plugins][4]) and works\nwell as a filtering [MTA][3]. It also works well as a [MSA][5] running on\nport 587 with auth and [dkim_sign][6] plugins enabled.\n\nHaraka makes no attempt to be a mail store (like Exchange or Postfix/Exim/Qmail),\na [LDA][7], nor an IMAP server (like Dovecot or Courier). Haraka is\ntypically used **with** such systems.\n\nHaraka has a scalable outbound mail delivery engine built in. Mail\nmarked as `relaying` (such as via an `auth` plugin) is automatically\nqueued for outbound delivery.\n\n### Getting Help\n\n* [Join the mailing list][8] (implemented as a Haraka plugin)\n* Join us on IRC at `#haraka` on [freenode][14]\n* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/issues)\n\n\n### Screencast\n\n[Getting started with Haraka][2]\n\n### Why Use Haraka?\n\nHaraka's plugin architecture provides an easily extensible MTA that\ncomplements traditional MTAs that excel at managing mail stores but do\nnot have sufficient filtering.\n\nThe plugin system makes it easy to code new features. A typical example\nis providing qmail-like extended addresses to an Exchange system,\nwhereby you could receive mail as `user-anyword@domain.com`, and yet\nstill have it correctly routed to `user@domain.com`. This is a few lines of\ncode in Haraka.\n\nPlugins are provided for running mail through [SpamAssassin][9], validating\n[HELO][10] names, checking [DNS Blocklists][11], and [many others][12].\n\n\n### Installing Haraka\n\nHaraka requires [node.js][1] to run. Install Haraka with [npm][2]:\n\n```sh\n# If the second command gives \"nobody\" errors, uncomment & run the next command\n# npm -g config set user root\nnpm install -g Haraka\n```\n\nAfter installation, use the `haraka` binary to set up the service.\n\n### Running Haraka\n\nFirst, create the service:\n\n```sh\nharaka -i /path/to/haraka_test\n```\n\nThat creates the directory `haraka_test` with `config` and `plugin`\ndirectories within. It also sets the host name used by Haraka\nto the output of `hostname`.\n\nIf `hostname` is not correct, edit `config/host_list`. For example,\nto receive mail addressed to `user@domain.com`, add `domain.com` to the\n`config/host_list` file.\n\nFinally, start Haraka using root permissions:\n\n```sh\nharaka -c /path/to/haraka_test\n```\n\nAnd it will run.\n\n### Configure Haraka\n\nTo choose which plugins run, edit `config/plugins`. Plugins control the\noverall behaviour of Haraka. By default, only messages to domains listed\nin `config/host_list` will be accepted and then delivered via the\n`smtp-forward` plugin.

For log plugins like ([haraka-plugin-syslog](https://github.com/haraka/haraka-plugin-syslog)), refer to the plugin's docs.\n\nSee also\n------------------\n[https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/pull/119](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/pull/119)\n\nThe logline by default will be in the form of:\n\n    [level] [uuid] [origin]

example,\n\n    [DEBUG] [7F1C820F-DC79-4192-9AA6-5307354B20A6] [dnsbl] i like turtles\n\nIf you call the log method on the connection object, you can\nforego the connection as argument:\n\n    connection.logdebug(\"turtles all the way down\", plugin);\n\nand similarly for the log methods on the plugin object:\n\n    plugin.logdebug(\"he just really likes turtles\", connection);\n\nfailing to provide a connection and/or plugin object will leave\nthe default values in the log (currently \"core\").\n\nThis is implemented by testing for argument type in\nthe logger.js log\\* method. objects-as-arguments are then sniffed\nto try to determine if they're a connection or plugin instance.\n\nThe logfmt format is also supported and can be enabled by changing the format\nfrom `default` to `logfmt` in the `config/log.ini` file which will\nstart logging in the following format below.\n\n    level=PROTOCOL uuid=9FF7F70E-5D57-435A-AAD9-EA069B6159D9.1 source=core message=\"S: 354 go

Those mails will be delivered to the appropriate MX record\nfor that domain. Mails are queued onto your disk, and will deal appropriately\nwith temporary failures to retry delivery later.\n\nOutbound mails are defined as those that have set the `connection.relaying`\nflag to `true` via a plugin. The simplest way of doing that is to use SMTP\nAUTH, and have the client authenticate. For example using the `auth/flat_file`\nplugin. However it is very simple to write a custom plugin to do this.\n\nFor statistics on outbound mail use the `process_title` plugin. See the\ndocumentation for that plugin for details.\n\nTo flush the outbound queue (for temporary failed mails) hit the Haraka master\nprocess with the SIGHUP signal (via the `kill` command line tool).\n\nOutbound Configuration Files\n----------------------------\n\n### outbound.ini\n\n* `disabled`\n\nDefault: false. Allows one to temporarily disable outbound delivery, while\nstill receiving and queuing emails. This can be changed while Haraka is\nrunning.\n\n* `concurrency_max`\n\nDefault: 100. Specifies the maximum concurrent connections to make. Note that\nif using cluster (multiple CPUs) then this will be multiplied by the number\nof CPUs that you have.\n\n* `enable_tls`\n\nDefault: true. Switch to false to disable TLS for outbound mail.\n\nThis uses the same `tls_key.pem` and `tls_cert.pem` files that the `tls`\nplugin uses, along with other values in `tls.ini`. See the [tls plugin\ndocs](http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/tls.html) for information on generating those\nfiles.\n\nWithin `tls.ini` you can specify global options for the values `ciphers`,\n`requestCert` and `rejectUnauthorized`, alternatively you can provide\nseparate values by putting them under a key: `[outbound]`, such as:\n\n```\n[outbound]\nciphers=!DES\n```\n\n* `ipv6_enabled`\n\nWhen this has a \"true\" value inside (usually a `1`), it defaults to an 'AAAA'\nlookup first for each MX record, and uses those hosts to send email via.\n\n* `always_split`\n\nDefault: false. By default, Haraka groups message recipients by domain so that\nmessages with multiple recipients at the same domain get sent in a single SMTP\nsession. When `always_split` is enabled, each recipient gets a queue entry and\ndelivery in its own SMTP session. This carries a performance penalty but\nenables more flexibility in mail delivery and bounce handling.\n\n* `received_header`\n\nDefault: \"Haraka outbound\". If this text is any string except *disabled*, the\nstring is attached as a `Received` header to all outbound mail just before it is queued.\n\n* `connect_timeout`\n\nTimeout for connecting to remote servers. Default: 30s\n\n* `pool_timeout`\n\nOutbound mail uses \"pooled\" connections. An unused pool connection will send\na QUIT after this time. Default: 50s\n\nPooled connections means that a mail to a particular IP address will hold that\nconnection open and use it the next time it is requested. This helps with\nlarge scale outbound mail. If you don't send lots of mail it is advised to\nlower the `pool_timeout` value since it may upset receiving mail servers.\n\nSetting this value to `0` will effectively disable the use of pools. You may\nwish to set this if you have a `get_mx` hook that picks outbound servers on\na per-email basis (rather than per-domain).\n\n* `pool_concurrency_max`\n\nSet this to `0` to completely disable the pooling code.\n\nThis value determines how many concurrent connections can be made to a single\nIP address (destination) in the pool. Default: 10 connections.\n\n### outbound.bounce\\_message\n\nSee \"Bounce Messages\" below for details.\n\nThe HMail Object\n----------------\n\nMany hooks (see below) pass in a `hmail` object.\n\nYou likely won't ever need to call methods on this object, so they are left\nundocumented here.\n\nThe attributes of an `hmail` object that may be of use are:\n\n* path - the full path to the queue file\n* filename - the filename within the queue dir\n* num_failures - the number of times this mail has been temp failed\n* notes - notes you can store on a hmail object (similar to `transaction.notes`)\n  to allow you to pass information between outbound hooks\n* todo - see below\n\nThe ToDo Object\n---------------\n\nThe `todo` object contains information about how to deliver this mail. Keys\nyou may be interested in are:\n\n* rcpt_to - an Array of `Address`[1] objects - the rfc.2821 recipients of this mail\n* mail_from - an `Address`[1] object - the rfc.2821 sender of this mail\n* domain - the domain this mail is going to (see `always_split` above)\n* notes - the original transaction.notes for this mail, also contains the\n  following useful keys:\n** outbound_ip - the IP address to bind to (note do not set this manually,\n  use the `get_mx` hook)\n** outbound_helo - the EHLO domain to use (again, do not set manually)\n* queue_time - the epoch milliseconds time when this mail was queued\n* uuid - the original transaction.uuid\n\nOutbound Mail Hooks\n-------------------\n\n### The queue\\_outbound hook\n\nThe first hook that is called prior to queueing an outbound mail is the\n`queue_outbound` hook. Only if all these hooks return `CONT` (or if there are\nno hooks) will the mail be queued for outbound delivery. A return of `OK` will\nindicate that the mail has been queued in some custom manner for outbound\ndelivery. Any of the `DENY` return codes will cause the message to be\nappropriately rejected.\n\n### The send\\_email hook\n\nParameters: `next, hmail`\n\nCalled just as the email is about to be sent.\n\nRespond with `next(DELAY, delay_seconds)` to defer sending the email at this time.\n\n### The get\\_mx hook\n\nParameters: `next, hmail, domain`\n\nUpon starting delivery the `get_mx` hook is called, with the parameter set to\nthe domain in question (for example a mail to `user@example.com` will call the\n`get_mx` hook with `(next, hmail, domain)` as parameters). This is to allow\nyou to implement a custom handler to find MX records. For most installations\nthere is no reason to implement this hook - Haraka will find the correct MX\nrecords for you.\n\nThe MX record is sent via next(OK, mx) and can be one of:\n\n* A string of one of the following formats:\n    * hostname\n    * hostname:port\n    * ipaddress\n    * ipaddress:port\n* An MX object of the form: `{priority: 0, exchange: hostname}` with the \nfollowing optional properies:\n       * `port` to specify an alternate port\n       * `bind` to specify an outbound IP address to bind to\n       * `bind_helo` to specify an outbound helo for IP address to bind to\n       * `using_lmtp` boolean to specify that delivery should be attempted using \n          LMTP instead of SMTP.\n       *  `auth_user` to specify an AUTH username (required if AUTH is desired)\n       *  `auth_pass` to specify an AUTH password (required if AUTH is desired)\n       *  `auth_type` to specify an AUTH type that should be used with the MX.\nIf this is not specified then Haraka will pick an appropriate method.\n* A list of MX objects in an array, each in the same format as above.\n\n### The deferred hook\n\nParameters: `next, hmail, {delay: ..., err: ...}`\n\nIf the mail is temporarily deferred, the `deferred` hook is called. The hook\nparameter is an object with keys: `delay` and `err`, which explain the delay\n(in seconds) and error message.\n\nIf you want to stop at this point, and drop the mail completely, then you\ncan call `next(OK)`.\n\nIf you want to change the delay, then call `next(DENYSOFT, delay_in_seconds)`.\nUsing this you can define a custom delay algorithm indexed by\n`hmail.num_failures`.\n\n### The bounce hook\n\nParameters: `next, hmail, error`\n\nIf the mail completely bounces then the `bounce` hook is called. This is *not*\ncalled if the mail is issued a temporary failure (a 4xx error code). The hook\nparameter is the error message received from the remote end as an `Error` object.\nThe object may also have the following properties:\n\n* mx - the MX object that caused the bounce\n* deferred_rcpt - the deferred recipients that eventually bounced\n* bounced_rcpt - the bounced recipients\n\nIf you do not wish to have a bounce message sent to the originating sender of the\nemail then you can return `OK` from this hook to stop it from sending a bounce message.\n\n### The delivered hook\n\nParameters: `next, hmail, params`\n\nParams is a list of: `[host, ip, response, delay, port, mode, ok_recips, secured]`\n\nWhen mails are successfully delivered to the remote end then the `delivered`\nhook is called. The return codes from this hook have no effect, so it is only\nuseful for logging the fact that a successful delivery occurred.\n \n* `host` - Hostname of the MX that the message was delivered to,\n* `ip` - IP address of the host that the message was delivered to,\n* `response` - Variable contains the SMTP response text returned by the host \nthat received the message and will typically contain the remote queue ID and\n* `delay` - Time taken between the queue file being created and the \nmessage being delivered.\n* `port` - Port number that the message was delivered to.\n* `mode` - Shows whether SMTP or LMTP was used to deliver the mail.\n* `ok_recips` - an `Address`[1] array containing all of the recipients that were\nsuccessfully delivered to.\n* `secured` - A boolean denoting if the connection used TLS or not.\n\nOutbound IP address\n-------------------\n\nNormally the OS will decide which IP address will be used for outbound \nconnections using the IP routing table.  \n\nThere are instances where you may want to separate outbound traffic on \ndifferent IP addresses based on sender, domain or some other identifier.  \nTo do this, the IP address that you want to use *must* be bound to an \ninterface (or alias) on the local system.\n\nAs described above the outbound IP can be set using the `bind` parameter\nand also the outbound helo for the IP can be set using the `bind_ehlo` \nparameter returned my the `get_mx` hook or during the reception of the message \nyou can set a transaction note in a plugin to tell Haraka which outbound IP \naddress you would like it to use when it tries to deliver the message:\n\n`````\nconnection.transaction.notes.outbound_ip = '1.2.3.4';\nconnection.transaction.notes.outbound_helo = 'mail-2.example.com';\n`````\n\nNote: if the `get_mx` hook returns a `bind` and `bind_helo` parameter, then\nthis will be used in preference to the transaction note.\n\nAUTH\n----\n\nIf you wish to use AUTH for a particular domain or domains, or you wish to\nforce all mail to an outbound service or smart host that requires authentication\nthen you can use the `get_mx` hook documented above to do this by supplying\nboth `auth_user` and `auth_pass` properties in an MX object.\n\nIf AUTH properties are supplied and the remote end does not offer AUTH or there\nare no compatible AUTH methods, then the message will be sent without AUTH and\na warning will be logged.\n\n\nBounce Messages\n---------------\n\nThe contents of the bounce message are configured by a file called\n`config/outbound.bounce_message`. If you look at this file you will see it\ncontains several template entries wrapped in curly brackets. These will be\npopulated as follows:\n\nOptional: Possibility to add HTML code (with optional image) to the bounce message is possible \nby adding the files `config/outbound.bounce_message_html`. An image can be attached \nto the mail by using `config/outbound.bounce_message_image`.\n\n* pid - the current process id\n* date - the current date when the bounce occurred\n* me - the contents of `config/me`\n* from - the originating sender of the message\n* msgid - a uuid for the mail\n* to - the end recipient of the message, or the first recipient if it was to\nmultiple people\n* reason - the text from the remote server indicating why it bounced\n\nFollowing the bounce message itself will be a copy of the entire original\nmessage.\n\nCreating a mail internally for outbound delivery\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSometimes it is necessary to generate a new mail from within a plugin.\n\nTo do that, you can use the `outbound` module directly:\n\n    var outbound = require('./outbound');\n    \n    var plugin = this;\n    \n    var to = 'user@example.com';\n    var from = 'sender@example.com';\n    \n    var contents = [\n        \"From: \" + from,\n        \"To: \" + to,\n        \"MIME-Version: 1.0\",\n        \"Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\",\n        \"Subject: Some subject here\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Some email body here\",\n        \"\"].join(\"\\n\");\n        \n    var outnext = function (code, msg) {\n        switch (code) {\n            case DENY:  plugin.logerror(\"Sending mail failed: \" + msg);\n                        break;\n            case OK:    plugin.loginfo(\"mail sent\");\n                        next();\n                        break;\n            default:    plugin.logerror(\"Unrecognized return code from sending email: \" + msg);\n                        next();\n        }\n    };\n    \n    outbound.send_email(from, to, contents, outnext);\n\nThe callback on `send_email()` is passed `OK` if the mail is successfully\nqueued to disk, not when it is successfully delivered. To check delivery\nstatus you still need to hook `delivered` and `bounce` to know if it was\nsuccessfully delivered.\n\nThe callback parameter may be omitted if you don't need to handle errors\nshould queueing to disk fail e.g:\n\n    outbound.send_email(from, to, contents);\n\nYou can pass various options to `outbound.send_email` like so:\n\n    outbound.send_email(from, to, contents, outnext, options);\n\nWhere `options` is a Object that may contain the following keys:\n\n| Key/Value              | Description                                                                               |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| `dot_stuffed: true`    | Use this if you are passing your content dot-stuffed (a dot at the start of a line is doubled, like it is in SMTP conversation, see [RFC 2821](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2821#section-4.5.2).|\n| `notes: { key: value}` | In case you need notes in the new transaction that `send_email()` creates. |\n| `remove_msgid: true`   | Remove any Message-Id header found in the message.  If you are reading a message in from the filesystem and you want to ensure that a generated Message-Id header is used in preference over the original.  This is useful if you are releasing mail from a quarantine. |\n| `remove_date: true`    | Remove any Date header found in the message.  If you are reading a message in from the filesystem and you want to ensure that a generated Date header is used in preference over the original.  This is useful if you are releasing mail from a quarantine. |\n| `origin: Object`       | Adds object as argument to logger.log calls inside outbound.send_email. Useful for tracking which Plugin/Connection/HMailItem object generated email. | \n\n\n    outbound.send_email(from, to, contents, outnext, { notes: transaction.notes });\n\n[1]: `Address` objects are [address-rfc2821 objects](https://github.com/haraka/node-address-rfc2821).\n\n","dir":"/en/core","path":"/en/core/Outbound","extension":".md","slug":"Outbound","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.384Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T13:57:35.862Z","to":"/core/Outbound","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905031},"$loki":18},{"title":"Transaction Object","position":15,"category":"Core","toc":[{"id":"api","depth":2,"text":"API"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"An SMTP transaction is valid from MAIL FROM time until RSET or \"final-dot\"."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"api"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#api","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"API"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"transaction.uuid"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A unique UUID for this transaction.

See `Body Object`.\n\n* transaction.attachment\\_hooks(start)\n\nSets a callback for when we see an attachment if `parse_body` has been set.\n\nThe `start` event will receive `(content_type, filename, body, stream)` as\nparameters.\n\nThe stream is a `ReadableStream` - see http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html for\ndetails on how this works.\n\nIf you set stream.connection then the stream will apply backpressure to the\nconnection, allowing you to process attachments before the connection has\nended. Here is an example which stores attachments in temporary files using\nthe `tmp` library from npm and tells us the size of the file:\n\n    exports.hook_data = function (next, connection) {\n        // enable mail body parsing\n        connection.transaction.parse_body = true;\n        connection.transaction.attachment_hooks(\n            function (ct, fn, body, stream) {\n                start_att(connection, ct, fn, body, stream)\n            }\n        );\n        next();\n    }\n\n    function start_att (connection, ct, fn, body, stream) {\n        connection.loginfo(\"Got attachment: \" + ct + \", \" + fn + \" for user id: \" + connection.transaction.notes.hubdoc_user.email);\n        connection.transaction.notes.attachment_count++;\n\n        stream.connection = connection; // Allow backpressure\n        stream.pause();\n\n        var tmp = require('tmp');\n\n        tmp.file(function (err, path, fd) {\n            connection.loginfo(\"Got tempfile: \" + path + \" (\" + fd + \")\");\n            var ws = fs.createWriteStream(path);\n            stream.pipe(ws);\n            stream.resume();\n            ws.on('close', function () {\n                connection.loginfo(\"End of stream reached\");\n                fs.fstat(fd, function (err, stats) {\n                    connection.loginfo(\"Got data of length: \" + stats.size);\n                    // Close the tmp file descriptor\n                    fs.close(fd, function(){});\n                });\n            });\n        });\n    }\n\n* transaction.discard\\_data = true|false [default: false]\n\nSet this flag to true to discard all data as it arrives and not store in\nmemory or on disk (in the message\\_stream property). You can still access\nthe attachments and body if you set parse\\_body to true. This is useful\nfor systems which do not need the full email, just the attachments or\nmail text.\n\n* transaction.set\\_banner(text, html)\n\nSets a banner to be added to the end of the email. If the html part is not\ngiven (optional) then the text part will have each line ending replaced with\n`<br/>` when being inserted into HTML parts.\n\n* transaction.add\\_body\\_filter(ct_match, filter)\n\nAdds a filter to be applied to body parts in the email.  ct\\_match should be a\nregular expression to match against the full content-type line, or a string to\nmatch at the start, e.g. `/^text\\/html/` or `'text/plain'`.  filter will be\ncalled when each body part matching ct_match is complete.  It receives three\nparameters, the content-type line, the encoding name, and a buffer with the\nfull body part.  It should return a buffer with the desired contents of the\nbody in the same encoding.\n\n* transaction.results\n\nStore results of processing in a structured format.

This plugin has support for both the [maxmind](https://github.com/runk/node-maxmind) and [geoip-lite](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip) node modules.\n\n# INSTALL\n\nInstall the npm geoip module you prefer:\n\n    npm install maxmind\n      or\n    npm install -g geoip-lite\n\nIf both are installed, maxmind will be preferred as it's faster and also provides ASN data. The maxmind module requires manual download of the GeoIP databases. The npm module `maxmind-geolite-mirror` will download the files and keep them up-to-date if you run it periodically.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /usr/local/share/GeoIP\nnpm install -g maxmind-geolite-mirror\n/usr/local/bin/maxmind-geolite-mirror\n```\n\n# DESCRIPTION\n\nGeoIP results are stored in connection.notes.geoip and connection.[results](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/blob/master/docs/Results.md) .connect.geoip. The following information is typically available:\n\n    continent: NA,\n    country:   US,\n\nIf the GeoIP city database is available, the following may also be available:\n\n    region:   CA,\n    city:     San Francisco,\n    ll:       [37.7484, -122.4156],\n    distance: 1539    // in kilometers\n    range:    [ 3479299040, 3479299071 ],\n\n`connect.geoip` also adds entries like this to your logs:\n\n    [connect.geoip] US\n    [connect.geoip] US, WA\n    [connect.geoip] US, WA, Seattle\n    [connect.geoip] US, WA, Seattle, 1319km\n\nCalculating the distance requires the public IP of this mail server. This may\nbe the IP that Haraka is bound to. If not, make sure that `utils.get_public_ip`\ncan figure it out (via STUN or in `smtp.ini`).\n\n# CONFIG\n\n- distance\n\nPerform the geodesic distance calculations. Calculates the distance \"as the\ncrow flies\" from the remote mail server.\n\nThis calculation requires a 'from' IP address. This will typically be the\npublic IP of your mail server. If Haraka is bound to a private IP, net\\_utils\nwill attempt to determine your public IP. If that doesn't work, edit\nconfig/smtp.ini and set `public_ip`.\n\n- show\\_city\n\nshow city data in logs and headers. City data is less accurate than country.\n\n- show\\_region in logs and headers. Regional data are US states, Canadian\n  provinces and such.\n\nSet a connection result to true if the distance exceeds this many kilometers.\n\n- too\\_far=4000\n\n- [asn]report_as\n\nPermits reporting the ASN as another plugin (such as connect.asn).\n\n# SPAM PREDICTION WITH DISTANCE\n\n[Spatio-temporal Network-level Automatic Reputation Engine](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~feamster/papers/snare-usenix09.pdf)\n\n    \"For ham, 90% of the messages travel about 4,000 km or less. On the\n    other hand, for spam, only 28% of messages stay within this range.\"\n\nObservations in 2014 suggest that geodesic distance continues to be an\nexcellent predictor of spam.\n\n\n# LIMITATIONS\n\nThe distance calculations are more concerned with being fast than\naccurate. The MaxMind location data is collected from whois and is of\nlimited accuracy. MaxMind offers more accurate data for a fee.\n\nFor distance calculations, the earth is considered a perfect sphere. In\nreality, it is not. Accuracy should be within 1%.\n\nThis plugin does not update the GeoIP databases. You may want to.\n\n\n# SEE ALSO\n\nMaxMind: http://www.maxmind.com/\n\nDatabases: http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database\n\n\n# TODO\n\nKeep an eye on node-geoip and see if they add ASN support.

To\nmimic the lookup\\_rdns.strict plugin, set no\\_rdns=true.\n\n    [reject]\n    ; reject if the IP address has no PTR record\n    no_rdns=false\n\n    ; reject if the FCrDNS test fails\n    no_fcrdns=false\n\n    ; reject if the PTR points to a hostname without a valid TLD\n    invalid_tld=false\n\n    ; reject if the rDNS is generic, examples:\n    ; 1.2.3.4.in.addr.arpa\n    ; c-67-171-0-90.hsd1.wa.comcast.net\n    generic_rdns=false\n\n\n## ANTI-SPAM EFFECTS\n\nThe reverse DNS of zombie PCs in bot nets is out of the bot operators control.\nThis presents a significant hurdle for a large portion of the hosts that\nattempt spam delivery.\n\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\n\nFrom Wikipedia: [Forward Confirmed Reverse DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCrDNS)\n\n1. First a reverse DNS lookup (PTR query) is performed on the IP address,\n   which returns a list of zero or more PTR records.\n\n2. For each domain name returned in the PTR query results, a regular\n   'forward' DNS lookup (type A or AAAA query) is then performed.\n\n3. Any A or AAAA records returned by the second query are then compared\n   against the original IP address. If there is a match, FCrDNS passes.\n\n\n## iprev\n\nThe iprev results are added to the Authentication-Results header.\n\n[RFC 1912](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1912.txt)\n[RFC 5451](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5451.txt)\n[RFC 7001](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7001#section-3)\n\n2.6.3.  \"iprev\" Results\n\n   pass:  The DNS evaluation succeeded, i.e., the \"reverse\" and\n      \"forward\" lookup results were returned and were in agreement.\n\n   fail:  The DNS evaluation failed.  In particular, the \"reverse\" and\n      \"forward\" lookups each produced results, but they were not in\n      agreement, or the \"forward\" query completed but produced no\n      result, e.g., a DNS RCODE of 3, commonly known as NXDOMAIN, or an\n      RCODE of 0 (NOERROR) in a reply containing no answers, was\n      returned.\n\n   temperror:  The DNS evaluation could not be completed due to some\n      error that is likely transient in nature, such as a temporary DNS\n      error, e.g., a DNS RCODE of 2, commonly known as SERVFAIL, or\n      other error condition resulted.  A later attempt may produce a\n      final result.\n\n   permerror:  The DNS evaluation could not be completed because no PTR\n      data are published for the connecting IP address, e.g., a DNS\n      RCODE of 3, commonly known as NXDOMAIN, or an RCODE of 0 (NOERROR)\n      in a reply containing no answers, was returned.  This prevented\n      completion of the evaluation.  A later attempt is unlikely to\n      produce a final result.\n\n","dir":"/en/plugins","path":"/en/plugins/connect.fcrdns","extension":".md","slug":"connect.fcrdns","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.433Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T19:39:04.134Z","to":"/plugins/connect.fcrdns","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905141},"$loki":33},{"title":"daemonize","position":43,"category":"Plugins","toc":[{"id":"configuration","depth":2,"text":"Configuration"},{"id":"init-script","depth":2,"text":"Init-Script"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"IMPORTANT NOTE: This plugin should not be used any more and it will\nthrow an error and prevent Haraka from starting."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nDaemonization is now built into Haraka.

consists of the following:\n\n* First subdomain of rDNS is stripped off (but no shorter than the domain boundary). This is considered a _hostid_.\n* Envelope sender is the _sender_.\n* RCPT TO would supply the _recipient_.\n\n_hostid_ in above notation is chosen unless:\n\n1. The connecting host has no PTR record, a.k.a. reverse DNS (rDNS). [gl]\n1. The rDNS record contains the first two or last two octets of the IP address. [fcrdns]\n1. The rDNS record contains the ‘short’, decimal, or hex representation of the full IP address. [fcrdns] [gl]\n1. Multiple rDNS records are returned. [gl]\n1. The rDNS record cannot be verified by forward confirmation (e.g. FCrDNS). [fcrdns]\n1. The top-level-domain (TLD) used is not valid. [gl]\n\nIn other cases, it's set to be the remote party's IP address.\n\nWe define the following time periods:\n\n* _black_:  between first connect and start of _gray_. Defer.\n* _gray_:   between _black_ and start of _white_. Allow. Host must re-try within this window.\n* _white_:  comes after _gray_. Allow up until the end of period, then let the record expire in case no connections were made.\n\n### Algorithm\n\nThe greylist algo is as following:\n\n  * Party connects. All FcrDNS & DNSWL checks are run by earlier plugins.\n  * Party sends _recipient_\n    * If not already whitelisted\n        * Check _tuple_ color (compare current TS against record creation TS)\n            * _black_?\n                * Create if no record exists. Defer.\n            * _gray_?\n                * Allow. Promote record to _white_ status.\n            * _white_?\n                * Allow.

Connections scoring in excess of specified thresholds are rewarded or [penalized](#penalties) in proportionate ways.\n\n## Description\n\nHaraka includes some excellent plugins that detect message or sender patterns that are indicative of spam. [Some][sa-url] [plugins][snf-url] [have][fcrdns-url] [accuracy][uribl-url] rates above 95%. Detecting messages incorrectly 5% of the time means that some portion of ham will get blocked and some portion of spam will get delivered. The traditional solution is to permit users to specify their filtering aggressiveness, and then suffer the consequences (blocked ham -vs- too much spam).\n\nBy scoring and weighting several \"95+\" plugins, accuracy rates above 99% are attainable. With a half dozen such plugins, **99.99% accuracy** is attainable. With karma, good senders with good history can occasionally fail tests (false positives) and still deliver their mail. Senders with poor history will have a much harder time.\n\n### Karma Prereqs\n\nOne challenge for mail filtering is that filters (or plugins, in Haraka's case) are usually called in sequence. A message passes from one filter to the next in a pipeline and each filter gets to choose \"yeah or nay.\" In order for karma to transcend this limit, karma requires that **every** filter passes every message. Nearly all Haraka plugins have a `reject` or `deny` option for this reason.\n\nIn order to score a filters results, filters must save their results to the [Result Store][results-url]. Karma will see that and apply the award specified in `karma.ini`.\n\n\n## How Karma Works\n\nKarma takes a holistic view of **connections**. During the connection, karma collects these results and applies the [result_awards](#awards) defined in `karma.ini`. Once a connection/message exceeds the threshold.negative score (default: -8), karma rejects it at the next [deny]hook.\n\nThe scoring mechanism is not dissimilar to [SpamAssassin][sa-url], but Karma has some particular advantages:\n\n    * Runs entirely in Node, so it's very fast\n    * Async and very scalable.\n    * Builds sender and network reputation databases\n    * Has access to connection properties (relaying, port, auth attempts, etc..)\n    * Access to raw SMTP commands (data + formatting inspection)\n    * Can reject connections before DATA (save lots of bandwidth)\n\nKarma is not a replacement for content filters. Karma focuses on the quality of the **connection**. Content filters (bayes\\*) focus on the content of the **message**. Karma works best *with* content filters.\n\n\n# CONFIG\n\nSee config/karma.ini for options and inline documentation.\n\n\n## <a name=\"awards\"></a>AWARDS\n\nKarma allows the site administrator to control how much weight to assign to\nplugin results, providing a great deal of control over what results are\nworth rejecting for.\n\nKarma begins scoring the connection when the first packet arrives. The IP reputation, [sender OS][p0f-url], [GeoIP location][geoip-url], [DNSBL][dnsbl-url] listing, and [FCrDNS][fcrdns-url] are often a sufficient basis for rejecting a connection without ever blocking a ham.\n\nKarma performs checks early and often, maximizing the penality it can exact upon bad mailers.\n\n\n## <a name=\"penalties\"></a>Penalties\n\n### Deny / Reject\n\nWhen connections become worse than [thresholds]negative, they are denied during the next [deny]hook.\n\n### History\n\nKarma history is computed as the number of good - bad connections.\n\nWhen each connection ends, *karma* records the result. When a sufficient history has been built for an IP or ASN, future connections from that address(es) will get a positive or negative karma award.\n\nThe reward is purposefully small, to permit good senders in bad neighborhoods to still send.\n\n### <a name=\"delay\"></a>Connection Delays\n\nConnection delays (aka tarpitting, teergrubing, early talker) slow down a SMTP conversation by inserting artificial delays. Karma increases connection delays adaptively as connection quality changes.\n\nKarma's delay goals:\n\n    1. Don't delay valid senders\n    2. Penalize senders in proportion to their karma score\n    3. Dampen bruteforce AUTH attacks.\n    4. Since the only *cost* we can exact from miscreants is time, and connections are cheap to maintain, keep miscreants online as long as possible.\n\nThere are three tarpit options:\n\n    [tarpit]\n    * delay=0   (seconds to delay,      default: 0)\n    * max=5     (max seconds to delay,  default: 5)\n\nWhen set to zero, the value of the delay is adaptive, calculated proportional\nto the karma score of the connection. Connections with good karma will see no\ndelay and bad ones will see long delays.\n\nWhen delay is non-zero, each SMTP response will be delayed by that many seconds.\n\nIn practice, most naughty senders abandon the connection when forced to\nwait more than a handful of seconds. `max` sets the maximum delay between\nresponses.\n\nWhen using `karma`, do not use Haraka's `tarpit` plugin.\n\n## Included Tests\n\nConnection data that karma considers:\n\n* [IP Reputation](#IP_Reputation)\n* [ASN reputation](#Neighbor_Reputation)\n* DENY events by other plugins\n* envelope sender from a spammy TLD\n* [malformed envelope addresses](#malformed_env)\n* [unrecognized SMTP commands](#unrecognized)\n* matching *env from* and *env to* name (rare in ham, frequent in spam)\n\nThe data from these tests are helpful but the real power of karma is [scoring\nthe results](#awards) of other plugins. See karma.ini for a rich set of examples.\n\n\n### <a name=\"IP_Reputation\"></a>IP Reputation\n\nKarma records the number of good, bad, and total connections.  The results\nare accessible to other plugins as well.\n\n    var karma = connection.results.get('karma');\n\nThe karma result object contains at least the following:\n\n    score: 0,         <- score for this connection\n    history: 0,       <- score for all connections\n       good: 0,       <- qty of past 'good' connections\n       bad: 0,        <- qty of past 'bad' connections\n    connections: 0,   <- total past connections\n    pass: [],         <- tests that added positive karma\n    fail: [],         <- tests that added negative karma\n\nIf an IP has at least 5 connections and all are good or bad, and `all_good` or\n`all_bad` result will be added to the `pass` or `fail` test list. This are\nvery good indicators of future connection quality and are scored in karma.ini.\n\n### <a name=\"Neighbor_Reputation\"></a>ASN / Network Neighborhood Reputation\n\n    [asn]\n    enable=true    (default: true)\n    report_as\n\nWhen [asn]enable is true, karma records the number of good and bad\nconnections from each ASN.\n\nASNs with less than 5 karma points in either direction are ignored.\n\n#### report\\_as\n\nStore the ASN results as another plugin. Example: I set `report_as=asn`, so that karma history for an ASN is reported with the ASN plugin data. A practical consequence of changing report_as is that the award location in karma.ini would need to change from:\n\n    NNN karma | pass | equals | asn_all_good |  2\n    NNN karma | fail | equals | asn_all_bad  | -3\n\nto: \n\n    NNN asn | pass | equals | asn_all_good |  2\n    NNN asn | fail | equals | asn_all_bad  | -3\n\n### <a name=\"malformed_env\"></a>Malformed Envelope Addresses\n\nVery old versions of Outlook Express and some malware senders don't bother complying with the RFC (5321, 2821, 821) address format. Karma checks the envelope from and to addresses for a common RFC ignorant pattern that is highly correlated with malware.\n\n\n### <a name=\"unrecognized\"></a>Unrecognized SMTP verbs/commands\n\nCertain bruteforce password hacking tools have a pre-programmed SMTP path\nthat ignores SMTP responses. After EHLO, they attempt AUTH,LOGIN with a valid\nusername. To bruteforce a password often requires millions of attempts so each\nbot sprays a couple dozen connections at the target server. Better quality\nMTAs like Haraka have built-in auth protection that inserts timeouts\nbetween successive auth attempts. The bots work around that by dropping the\nconnection after each failure and reconnecting. The attempts are distributed\nso IP blocking is of limited effectiveness.\n\nTo combat these bruteforce attacks several strategies are called for:\n\n    1. Impose [connection delays](#delay)\n    2. Disable SMTP-AUTH when not encrypted. The bots rarely use STARTTLS.\n       Besides preventing user passwords from transiting the internet in clear\n       text, requiring TLS encryption also means AUTH is not available to\n       poorly written bots.\n    3. Having done #2, bot AUTH attempts show up as unrecognized commands.\n       Penalizing these with tarpitting and rate limiting will almost never\n       harm a legit sender but it will make it take much much longer for\n       attackers to bruteforce passwords.\n\n\n## LIMITATIONS\n\nKarma is most effective at filtering mail delivered by bots and rogue servers.\nSpam delivered by servers with good reputations normally pass karma's checks.\nExpect to use karma *with* content filters.\n\n\n[p0f-url]: /manual/plugins/connect.p0f.html\n[geoip-url]: https://github.com/haraka/haraka-plugin-geoip\n[dnsbl-url]: /manual/plugins/dnsbl.html\n[fcrdns-url]: http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/connect.fcrdns.html\n[uribl-url]: http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/data.uribl.html\n[sa-url]: http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/spamassassin.html\n[snf-url]: http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/messagesniffer.html\n[results-url]: http://haraka.github.io/manual/Results.html\n\n","dir":"/en/plugins","path":"/en/plugins/karma","extension":".md","slug":"karma","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.493Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T19:39:58.015Z","to":"/plugins/karma","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905231},"$loki":48},{"title":"limit","position":59,"category":"Plugins","toc":[{"id":"concurrency","depth":2,"text":"concurrency"},{"id":"history","depth":3,"text":"History"},{"id":"recipients","depth":2,"text":"recipients"},{"id":"unrecognized_commands","depth":2,"text":"unrecognized_commands"},{"id":"limitations","depth":3,"text":"Limitations"},{"id":"errors","depth":2,"text":"errors"},{"id":"too-high-counters","depth":2,"text":"Too high counters"},{"id":"too-low-counters","depth":2,"text":"Too low counters"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Apply several types of limits to SMTP connections."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Each limit type has a max value that can be defined in limit.ini.

Logging\n\nUnless errors are encountered, no logs are emitted.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe elasticsearch module has very robust error handling built in. If there's a\nconnection issue, errors such as these will be emitted when Haraka starts\nup:\n\n* Elasticsearch cluster is down!\n* No Living connections\n\nHowever, ES will continue attempting to connect and when the ES server becomes\navailable, logging will begin. If errors are encountered trying to save data\nto ES, they look like this:\n\n* No Living connections\n* Request Timeout after 30000ms\n\nThey normally fix themselves when ES resumes working properly.\n\n# Configuration\n\n* host - an IP or hostname of the ES server to connect to\n\n    host=127.0.0.2\n\n* pluginObject\n\nBy default, all plugin results are presented as `$plugin_name: { ... }`, at\nthe top level. If you prefer that all plugin results be nested inside an\nobject `$obj: { $plugin_name: { ...}`, set pluginObject to that object's key name\n\n    pluginObject=plugin\n\n\n* [ignore_hosts]\n\nA config file section for hosts whose results should not be stored in\nES. HAproxy servers, Nagios, and other hosts who monitor Haraka can be listed\nhere. The format for entries is host.name=true\n\n* [index]\n\n    transaction=smtp-transaction\n    connection=smtp-connection\n\nTransactions include all the connection information and are \"the good stuff.\"\nWhen a connection has transactions, the connection is not saved separately.\nThe distinction is that a connection is stored only when it has zero\ntransactions. The connections index tends to be mostly noise (monitoring,\nblocked connections, bruteforce auth attempts, etc.). To collapse them into\nthe same index, set the value for both identically.\n\n\n# Index map template\n\nCreating a map template will apply the template(s) to any future indexes that\nmatch the pattern/name in the template setting. This is how to manually apply\nan index map template:\n\n```json\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/haraka_results -d '\n{\n    \"template\" : \"smtp-*\",\n    \"mappings\" : {\n        \"haraka\" :

In Haraka, the `rcpt_to.*` plugins usually decide which domains and/or email addresses are deliverable. By default, everything else is rejected.\n\n**Relaying** is when a MTA accepts mail that is destined elsewhere. Back in the day (1980s), most MTAs permitted open relaying. Soon spammers abused our open relays (1990s) and left us with soiled mail queues. Now nearly all MTAs have relaying disabled and [MUAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_user_agent) are required to use a [MSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_submission_agent) to relay. Most MTAs (including Haraka) have MSA features and can serve both purposes.\n\nThis **relay** plugin provides Haraka with options for managing relay permissions.\n\n## Authentication\n\nOne way to enable relaying is [authentication](http://haraka.github.io/manual.html) via the auth plugins. Successful authentication enables relaying during _that_ SMTP connection. To securely offer SMTP AUTH, the [tls](http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/tls.html) plugin and at least one auth plugin must be enabled and properly configured. When that requirement is met, the AUTH SMTP extension will be advertised to SMTP clients.\n\n    % nc mail.example.com 587\n    220 mail.example.com ESMTP Haraka 2.4.0 ready\n    ehlo client.example.com\n    250-mail.example.com Hello client.example.com [192.168.0.1], Haraka is at your service.\n    250-PIPELINING\n    250-8BITMIME\n    250-SIZE 10000000\n    250 STARTTLS\n    quit\n    221 mail.example.com closing connection. Have a jolly good day.\n\nNotice that there's no AUTH advertised. We only permit authentication when the\nconnection is secured with TLS:\n\n    % openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:587 -starttls smtp\n    CONNECTED(00000003)\n    <snip long SSL certificate details>\n    ---\n    250 STARTTLS\n    ehlo client.example.com\n    250-mail.example.com Hello client.example.com [192.168.1.1], Haraka is at your service.\n    250-PIPELINING\n    250-8BITMIME\n    250-SIZE 10000000\n    250 AUTH PLAIN LOGIN\n    quit\n    221 mail.example.com closing connection. Have a jolly good day.\n    closed\n\nTo avoid port 25 restrictions, in 1998 we developed [SMTP submission](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2476) on port 587. As of January 2018, [RFC 8314](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8314) resurrects [SMTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTPS) on port 465 in favor of port 587 with STARTTLS. For optimal security and reliability, [MUAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_user_agent) should be configured to send mail to port 465 with TLS.\n\n## ACL (Access Control List)\n\nACL processing is enabled by setting acl=true in the [relay] section of\nrelay.ini:\n\n    [relay]\n    acl=true\n\nWith the Access Control List feature, relaying can be enabled for IPv4 and\nIPv6 networks. IP ranges listed in the ACL file are allowed to send mails\nwithout furthur checks.\n\n* `config/relay_acl_allow`\n\n    Allowed IP ranges in CIDR notation, one per line.\n\nBack in the day, ISPs enabled all of their IP space to relay.

If you reside somewhere technology evolves more slowly, you can still\nadd IP allocations to `relay_acl_allow` like so:\n\n    echo 'N.N.N.N/24' >> /path/to/haraka/config/relay_acl_allow\n\nA common use case for IP based relaying is to relay messages on behalf of\nanother mail server. If your organization has an Exchange server, using Haraka\nto filter inbound messages is a great choice. You might also want to relay\noutbound messages via Haraka as well, so they can be DKIM signed on their way\nto the internet. For such a use case, you would set 'acl=true' (the default)\nin the [relay] section of `relay.ini` and then add the external IP address\nof the corporate firewall to `config/relay_acl_allow`:\n\n    echo 'N.N.N.N/32' >> /path/to/haraka/config/relay_acl_allow\n\n\n## Force Route / Dest[ination] Domains\n\nForce routes and Destination Domains are enabled by setting in the [relay]\nsection of relay.ini:\n\n    [relay]\n    force_routing=false  (default: false)\n    dest_domains=false   (default: false)\n\nThese two features share another common config file:\n\n* `config/relay_dest_domains.ini`\n\nThe format is ini and entries are within the [domains] section. The key for each entry is the domain and the value is a JSON string. Within the JSON string, the currently supported keys are:\n\n    * action  (Dest Domains)\n    * nexthop (Force Route)\n\n### Force Route\n\nThink of force route as the equivalent of the transport map in Postfix or the smtproutes file in Qmail. Rather than looking up the MX for a host, the *nexthop* value from the entry in the config file is used.\n\nThe value of \"nexthop\": can be a hostname or an IP, optionally follow by :port.\n\nExample:\n\n    [domains]\n    test.com = { \"action\": \"continue\", \"nexthop\": \"127.0.0.1:2525\" }\n\n### Destination Domains\n\nAllowed destination/recipient domains.

Better set it to something much lower than this.\n    lookup_timeout = 29\n\n    ; bypass hosts that match these conditions\n    [skip]\n    ; hosts that relay through us\n    relaying = false\n    ; hosts that are SMTP AUTH'ed\n    auth = false\n\nThere's a special setting that would allow the plugin to emit a funny explanation text on SPF DENY, essentially meant to be visible to end-users that will receive the bounce. The text is `http://www.openspf.org/Why?s=${scope}&id=${sender_id}&ip=${connection.remote.ip}` and is enabled by:\n\n    [deny]\n    openspf_text = true\n    \n    ; in case you DENY on failing SPF on hosts that are relaying (but why?)\n    [deny_relay]\n    openspf_text = true\n\n### Things to Know\n\n* Most senders do not publish SPF records for their mail server *hostname*,\n  which means that the SPF HELO test rarely passes. During observation in 2014,\n  more spam senders have valid SPF HELO than ham senders. If you expect very\n  little from SPF HELO validation, you might still be disappointed.\n\n* Enabling error deferrals will cause excessive delays and perhaps bounced\n  mail for senders with broken DNS. Enable this only if you are willing to\n  delay and sometimes lose valid mail.\n\n* Broken SPF records by valid senders are common. Keep that in mind when\n  considering denial of SPF error results. If you deny on error, budget\n  time for instructing senders on how to correct their SPF records so they\n  can email you.\n\n* The only deny option most sites should consider is `mfrom_fail`. That will\n  reject messages that explicitely fail SPF tests. SPF failures have a high\n  correlation with spam. However, up to 10% of ham transits forwarders and/or\n  email lists which frequently break SPF. SPF results are best used as inputs\n  to other plugins such as DMARC, [spamassassin](http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/spamassassin.html), and [karma](http://haraka.github.io/manual/plugins/karma.html).\n\n* Heed well the implications of SPF, as described in [RFC 4408](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4408#section-9.3)\n\n    [defer]\n    helo_temperror\n    mfrom_temperror\n\n    [deny]\n    helo_none\n    helo_softfail\n    helo_fail\n    helo_permerror\n\n    mfrom_none\n    mfrom_softfail\n    mfrom_fail\n    mfrom_permerror\n    \n    openspf_text\n\n    ; SPF settings used when connection.relaying=true\n    [defer_relay]\n    helo_temperror\n    mfrom_temperror\n\n    [deny_relay]\n    helo_none\n    helo_softfail\n    helo_fail\n    helo_permerror\n\n    mfrom_none\n    mfrom_softfail\n    mfrom_fail\n    mfrom_permerror\n    \n    openspf_text\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThis plugin also provides a command-line test tool that can be used to debug SPF issues or to check results.\n\nTo check the SPF record for a domain:\n\n````\n# spf --ip 1.2.3.4 --domain fsl.com\nip=1.2.3.4 helo=\"\" domain=\"fsl.com\" result=Fail\n````\n\nTo check the SPF record for a HELO/EHLO name:\n\n````\n# spf --ip 1.2.3.4 --helo foo.bar.com\nip=1.2.3.4 helo=\"foo.bar.com\" domain=\"\" result=None\n````\n\nYou can add `--debug` to the option arguments to see a full trace of the SPF processing.\n\n### SPF Resource Record Type\n\nNode does not support the SPF DNS Resource Record type. Only TXT records are\nchecked.\n\nThis is a non-issue as < 1% (as of 2014) of SPF records use the SPF RR type.\nDue to lack of adoption, the next SPF revision will like likely deprecate the\nSPF RR type.\n\n","dir":"/en/plugins","path":"/en/plugins/spf","extension":".md","slug":"spf","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.579Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T14:05:11.164Z","to":"/plugins/spf","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905420},"$loki":74},{"title":"relay_all","position":69,"category":"Plugins","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This plugin is useful in spamtraps to accept mail to any host, and to allow\nany user from anywhere to send email."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Do NOT use this plugin on a real mail server, unless you really know what\nyou are doing.

Generate the PEM bundles in The Usual Way[TM] by concatenating the key, certificate, and CA/chain certs in that order. Example:\n\n```sh\ncat example.com.key example.com.crt ca.crt > config/tls/example.com.pem\n```\n\nAn example [acme.sh](https://acme.sh) deployment [script](https://github.com/msimerson/Mail-Toaster-6/blob/master/provision-letsencrypt.sh) demonstrates how to install [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certificates to the Haraka `config/tls`directory.\n\nHaraka has [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) support. When the remote MUA/MTA presents a servername during the TLS handshake and a TLS certificate with that Common Name matches, that certificate will be presented. If no match is found, the default certificate (see Certificate Files above) is presented.\n\n## Purchased Certificate\n\nIf you have a purchased certificate, append any intermediate/chained/ca-cert\nfiles to the certificate in this order:\n\n1. The CA signed SSL cert\n2. Any intermediate certificates\n3. The CA root certificate\n\nSee also [Setting Up TLS](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/wiki/Setting-up-TLS-with-CA-certificates)\n\n## Self Issued (unsigned) Certificate\n\nCreate a certificate and key file in the config directory with the following\ncommand:\n\n    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 2190 -newkey rsa:2048 \\\n            -keyout config/tls_key.pem -out config/tls_cert.pem\n\nYou will be prompted to provide details of your organization. Make sure the\nCommon Name is set to your servers Fully Qualified Domain Name, which should\nbe the same as the contents of your `config/me` file.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe following settings can be specified in `config/tls.ini`.\n\n### key\n\nSpecifies an alternative location for the key file. For multiple keys, use `key[]=` assignment for each. Non-absolute paths are relative to the `config/` directory.\n\nTo configure a single key and a cert chain, located in the `config/`\ndirectory, use the following in `tls.ini`:\n\n```ini\nkey=example.com.key.pem\ncert=example.com.crt-chain.pem\n```\n\nTo use multiple pairs of key and cert chain files outside of the haraka\n`config/` directory, configure instead:\n\n```ini\nkey[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.rsa.key.pem\ncert[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.rsa.crt-chain.pem\nkey[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.ecdsa.key.pem\ncert[]=/etc/ssl/private/example.com.ecdsa.crt-chain.pem\n```\n\n### cert\n\nSpecifies the location(s) for the certificate chain file. For multiple certificate chains, use `cert[]=` assignment for each. Non-absolute paths are relative to the `config/` directory. See the description of the `key` parameter for specific use.\n\n### no_tls_hosts\n\nIf needed, add this section to the `config/tls.ini` file and list any IP ranges that have broken TLS hosts. Ex:\n\n```ini\n[no_tls_hosts]\n192.168.1.3\n172.16.0.0/16\n```\n\nThe [Node.js TLS](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html) page has additional information about the following options.\n\n### ciphers\n\nA list of allowable ciphers to use. Example:\n\n    ciphers=EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+AES256:EDH+aRSA+AES256:EECDH+AES128:EDH+aRSA+AES128:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES\n\nSee also: [Strong SSL Ciphers](http://cipherli.st) and the [SSLlabs Test Page](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html)\n\n### honorCipherOrder\n\nIf specified, the list of configured ciphers is treated as the cipher priority from highest to lowest. The first matching cipher will be used, instead of letting the client choose. The default is `true`.\n\n### ecdhCurve\n\nSpecifies the elliptic curve used for ECDH or ECDHE ciphers.\nOnly one curve can be specified. The default is `prime256v1` (NIST P-256).\n\n### dhparam\n\nSpecifies the file containing the diffie-hellman parameters to use for DH or DHE key exchange. If this param or file is missing, it will be generated automatically. Default: `dhparams.pem`.\n\n### requestCert\n\nWhether Haraka should request a certificate from a connecting client.\n\n    requestCert=[true|false]  (default: true)\n\n\n### rejectUnauthorized\n\nReject connections from clients without a CA validated TLS certificate.\n\n    rejectUnauthorized=[true|false]  (default: false)\n\n\n### requireAuthorized\n\nWhen `rejectUnauthorized=false`, require validated TLS certificates on just the specified ports.\n\n```ini\nrequireAuthorized[]=465\n;requireAuthorized[]=587\n```\n\n\n### secureProtocol\n\nSpecifies the OpenSSL API function used for handling the TLS session. Choose\none of the methods described at the\n[OpenSSL API page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/ssl/ssl.html).\nThe default is `SSLv23_method`.\n\n\n### requestOCSP\n\nSpecifies that OCSP Stapling should be enabled, according to RFC 6066.\nStapling of OCSP messages allows the client to receive these along the\nTLS session setup instead of delaying the session setup by requiring a\nseparate http connection to the OCSP server.\n\n    requestOCSP=[true|false]  (default: false)\n\nOCSP responses from the OCSP server are cached in memory for as long as\nthey are valid, and get refreshed after that time. A server restart\nrequires the OCSP responses to be fetched again upon the first client\nconnection.\n\n\n## Inbound Specific Configuration\n\nBy default the above options are shared with outbound mail (either\nusing `smtp_forward`, `smtp_proxy` or plain outbound mail heading to\nan external destination). To make these options specific to inbound\nmail, put them under an `[inbound]` parameter group. Outbound options\ncan go under an `[outbound]` parameter group, and plugins that use\nSMTP tls for queueing such as `smtp_proxy` and `smtp_forward` can\nuse that plugin name for plugin specific options.\n\n","dir":"/en/plugins","path":"/en/plugins/tls","extension":".md","slug":"tls","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.589Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T14:05:22.546Z","to":"/plugins/tls","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905441},"$loki":77},{"title":"tarpit","position":75,"category":"Plugins","toc":[{"id":"usage","depth":2,"text":"Usage"},{"id":"configuration","depth":2,"text":"Configuration"},{"id":"plugin-timeout","depth":2,"text":"Plugin Timeout"},{"id":"logging","depth":2,"text":"Logging"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This plugin is designed to introduce deliberate delays on the response\nof every hook in order to slow down a connection.

Haraka was installed (where depends on your OS platform and whether you specified `-g`) or the Haraka install directory (haraka -i this_path). This example installs _my-great-plugin_ in the Haraka install directory:\n\n````\ncd /etc/haraka\nnpm install haraka-plugin-my-great-plugin\n````\n\nNPM then installs the plugin and its dependencies in a `node_modules` directory within the Haraka install directory.\n\n## Plugin Registry\n\nA mostly comprehensive list of plugins known to be working and maintained.\nCreate a PR adding yours to this

AUTH capability is only advertised after TLS/SSL negotiation (except for connections from the local host):\n\n    echo \"tls\n    auth/flat_file\" > config/plugins\n\nNow edit the flat file password file, and put in an appropriate username\nand password:\n\n    vi config/auth_flat_file.ini\n\nSee the documentation in docs/plugins/auth/flat\\_file.md for information about\nwhat can go in that file.\n\nNow you can start Haraka. That's all the configuration you need.\n\n    haraka -c .\n\nNow in another window you can run swaks to test this - be sure to substitute\nan email address you can monitor in place of youremail@yourdomain.com, and the\nusername and password you added for the --auth-user and --auth-password params:\n\n    swaks --to youremail@yourdomain.com --from test@example.com --server localhost \\\n      --port 587 --auth-user testuser --auth-password testpassword\n\nWatch the output of swaks and ensure no errors have occurred. Then watch\nthe recipient email address (easiest to make this your webmail account) and\nsee that the email arrived.\n\nYou are done!\n\n","dir":"/en/tutorials","path":"/en/tutorials/SettingUpOutbound","extension":".md","slug":"SettingUpOutbound","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.677Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T13:53:41.788Z","to":"/tutorials/SettingUpOutbound","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905489},"$loki":82},{"title":"watch - smtp connections in HTTP browser","menuTitle":"watch","position":91,"category":"Plugins","toc":[{"id":"enable-watch","depth":2,"text":"Enable Watch"},{"id":"tips","depth":2,"text":"Tips"},{"id":"interpretation-key","depth":2,"text":"Interpretation Key"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Watch SMTP traffic to your Haraka server in a web interface.

This\nmakes programming very easy, and is hence why we started using them in Haraka\nstarting with version 2.0.0.\n\nFor more information about the Stream API, see \nhttp://nodejs.org/api/stream.html\n\nIt's important to note that if you are using standard Haraka plugins then\nit's very unlikely you will need to change anything. Though you may want\nto configure `spool_dir` and `spool_after` in `config/smtp.ini`. However if\nyou have written custom plugins, continue reading.\n\nChanges To Look For\n-------------------\n\nFirstly, the incoming data in an email (the email body) is now stored in an\nobject which you can treat as a ReadableStream. To find if this is relevant\nfor you, look for instances of `data_lines` in your plugins.\n\nSecondly, if you parse the mail body, attachments are now provided as a\nstream, rather than custom start/data/end events. To find if this is relevant\nfor you, look for instances of `attachment_hooks` in your plugins.\n\nFixing data\\_lines plugins\n-------------------------\n\nAny plugins now working on each line of data will need to change to using a\nstream. The stream is called `transaction.message_stream`.\n\nThese changes may be complicated if you are iterating over each line and\ndoing something with the strings therein. However if you are piping the data\nto an application or over a network, your code will become significantly\nsimpler (and a lot faster).\n\nIn v1.x Haraka populated the `transaction.data_lines` array for each line of \ndata received.  If you were writing the data to a socket then you had to handle backpressure manually by checking the return of `write()` and adding \n`on('drain')` handlers like so:\n\n    var data_marker = 0;\n    var in_data = false;\n    var end_pending = true;\n    var send_data = function () {\n        in_data = true;\n        var wrote_all = true;\n        while (wrote_all && (data_marker < connection.transaction.data_lines.length)) {\n            var line = connection.transaction.data_lines[data_marker];\n            data_marker++;\n            wrote_all = socket.write(Buffer.from(line.replace(/^\\./, '..').replace(/\\r?\\n/g, '\\r\\n')), 'binary');\n            if (!wrote_all) return;\n        }\n        // we get here if wrote_all still true, and we got to end of data_lines\n        if (end_pending) {\n            end_pending = false;\n            // Finished...\n            socket.send_command('dot');\n        }\n    };\n    socket.on('drain', function () {\n        if (end_pending && in_data) {\n            setImmediate(function () { send_data() });\n        }\n    });\n\nIn v2.x this now becomes:\n\n    connection.transaction.message_stream.pipe(socket, {dot_stuffing: true, ending_dot: true});\n\nThis automatically chunks the data, handles backpressure and will apply any \nnecessary format changes.  See `docs/Transaction.md` for the full details.\n\nIf you need to handle the input data by line, then you will need to create \nyour own writable stream and then pipe the message to the stream and then \nextract the lines from the stream of data.  See `plugins/dkim_sign.js` for \nan example.\n\nFixing attachment\\_hooks plugins\n-------------------------------\n\nFor v1.x you passed in functions to `transaction.attachment_hooks()` as\nfollows:\n\n    transaction.attachment_hooks(\n        function (ctype, filename, body) {...}, // start\n        function (buf) {...}, // data\n        function () {...} // end\n    );\n\nThat has now changed to:\n\n    transaction.attachment_hooks(\n        function (ctype, filename, body, stream) {...}, // start\n    );\n\nThis allows you to attach the stream to other streams via `stream.pipe(dest)`.\n\nSometimes destination streams will apply backpressure on the sending stream,\nfor example if you are sending attachments to a remote service. In order\nfor this backpressure to apply to the connection itself (so that we don't\nhave to buffer up data in memory), we need to provide the connection object\nto the stream:\n\n    var transaction = connection.transaction;\n    transaction.attachment_hooks(\n        function (ctype, filename, body, stream) {\n            stream.connection = connection;\n            ...\n        }\n    );\n\nFor a full example of using attachment streams, see the Transaction.md\ndocumentation file.\n\n","dir":"/en/tutorials","path":"/en/tutorials/Migrating_from_v1_to_v2","extension":".md","slug":"Migrating_from_v1_to_v2","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.668Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T15:22:42.267Z","to":"/tutorials/Migrating_from_v1_to_v2","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905498},"$loki":84},{"title":"Writing Haraka Plugins","position":16,"category":"Tutorials","toc":[{"id":"the-design","depth":2,"text":"The Design"},{"id":"what-you-will-need","depth":2,"text":"What You Will Need"},{"id":"getting-started","depth":2,"text":"Getting Started"},{"id":"parsing-out-the-date","depth":2,"text":"Parsing Out The Date"},{"id":"rejecting-expired-emails","depth":2,"text":"Rejecting Expired Emails"},{"id":"fixing-up-unexpired-emails","depth":2,"text":"Fixing Up Unexpired Emails"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Part of the joy of using Haraka as your main mail server is having a strong\nplugin based system which means you control all aspects of how your mail is\nprocessed, accepted, and delivered."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Of course in order to control this you may at some point need to edit some\nsort of plugin file of your own to customise how things work.

The simplest one is a mere 5 lines\nof code."}]}]},"text":"\nPart of the joy of using Haraka as your main mail server is having a strong\nplugin based system which means you control all aspects of how your mail is\nprocessed, accepted, and delivered.\n\nOf course in order to control this you may at some point need to edit some\nsort of plugin file of your own to customise how things work. The good news\nis that writing plugins in Haraka is simple, even for novice coders. You\njust need a little knowledge of Javascript (and maybe some understanding of\nNode.js) and the world is your oyster.\n\nThis tutorial will run through a simple plugin which allows you to have\nemail addresses that expire in a short period of time. This is handy if you\nwant a *disposable email address* to use to sign up for a web site that you\ndon't wish to continually receive communication from.\n\nThe Design\n----------\n\nIn order to make this simple, we are going to simply let you have tagged\nemail addresses such as `user-20120515@domain.com` which will expire on the\n15th May, 2012. Haraka will then check the email has yet to expire, and\nreject mails to that address after the expiry date. If the address hasn't\nexpired yet it will re-write the address to `user@domain.com` before onward\ndelivery.\n\nWhat You Will Need\n------------------\n\n* Node.js and npm\n* Haraka\n* A text editor\n* [swaks][1]\n* A screwdriver\n\n[1]: http://jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nFirst install Haraka via npm if you haven't already:\n\n    $ sudo npm -g install Haraka\n\nNow we can create our project directory to get started with:\n\n    $ haraka -i /path/to/new_project\n\nMake sure you use a directory that doesn't exist for your project.\n\nNext, let's create a new plugin:\n\n    $ haraka -c /path/to/new_project -p rcpt_to.disposable\n\nThis should output a bunch of information about files it has created:\n\n    Plugin rcpt_to.disposable created\n\tNow edit javascript in:    /path/to/new_project/plugins/rcpt_to.disposable.js\n\tAdd the plugin to config:  /path/to/new_project/config/plugins\n\tAnd edit documentation in: /path/to/new_project/docs/plugins/rcpt_to.disposable.md\n\nSo let's do the second part now - load up the `config/plugins` file and lets\nset this up to test things. Comment out most of the plugins, except for\n`rcpt_to.in_host_list` and add in our new plugin, and change the queue\nplugin to `test_queue`. The final file should look like this:\n\n\t# default list of plugins\n\n\t# block mails from known bad hosts (see config/dnsbl.zones for the DNS zones queried)\n\t#dnsbl\n\n\t# allow bad mail signatures from the config/data.signatures file.\n\t#data.signatures\n\n\t# block mail from some known bad HELOs - see config/helo.checks.ini for configuration\n\t#helo.checks\n\n\t# block mail from known bad email addresses you put in config/mail_from.blocklist\n\t#mail_from.blocklist\n\n\t# Only accept mail where the MAIL FROM domain is resolvable to an MX record\n\t#mail_from.is_resolvable\n\n\t# Allow dated tagged addresses\n\trcpt_to.disposable\n\n\t# Only accept mail for your personal list of hosts\n\trcpt_to.in_host_list\n\n\t# Queue mail via qmail-queue\n\t#queue/qmail-queue\n\n\ttest_queue\n\nRemember that the ordering here is important - our new plugin has to come\nbefore `rcpt_to.in_host_list`.\n\nNow fire up your favourite editor and put the following into\nthe `plugins/rcpt_to.disposable.js` file:\n\n    exports.hook_rcpt = function (next, connection, params) {\n\t\tvar rcpt = params[0];\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Got recipient: \" + rcpt);\n\t\tnext();\n\t}\n\nAll we are doing here is logging the fact that we got the recipient.\n\nCheck this works. You'll need two terminal windows. In window 1:\n\n    $ echo LOGDEBUG > config/loglevel\n    $ echo myserver.com >> config/host_list\n    $ sudo haraka -c /path/to/new_project\n\nAnd in window 2:\n\n    $ swaks -h domain.com -t booya@myserver.com -f somewhere@example.com \\\n      -s localhost -p 25\n\nIn the logs you should see:\n\n    [INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Got recipient: <booya@myserver.com>\n\nWhich indicates everything is working. You should also have a file\n`/tmp/mail.eml` containing the email that swaks sent.\n\nParsing Out The Date\n--------------------\n\nNow lets check for emails with an expire date in them and turn them into\n`Date` objects. Edit your plugin file as follows:\n\n    exports.hook_rcpt = function (next, connection, params) {\n\t\tvar rcpt = params[0];\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Got recipient: \" + rcpt);\n\t\t\n\t\t// Check user matches regex 'user-YYYYMMDD':\n\t\tvar match = /^(.*)-(\\d{4})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})$/.exec(rcpt.user);\n\t\tif (!match) {\n\t\t\treturn next();\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t// get date - note Date constructor takes month-1 (i.e. Dec == 11).\n\t\tvar expiry_date = new Date(match[2], match[3]-1, match[4]);\n\t\t\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Email expires on: \" + expiry_date);\n\t\t\n\t\tnext();\n\t}\n\nStart haraka again and pass it the following email via swaks:\n\n    $ swaks -h domain.com -t booya-20120101@myserver.com \\\n      -f somewhere@example.com -s localhost -p 25\n\nAnd you should see now in the logs:\n\n    [INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Got recipient: <booya-20120101@myserver.com>\n    [INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Email expires on: Sun, 01 Jan 2012 05:00:00 GMT\n\nThe exact time may vary depending on your timezone, but it should be obvious\nwe now have a date object, which we can now compare to the current date.\n\nRejecting Expired Emails\n------------------------\n\nThe next edit we have to do is to add in code to compare to the current date\nand reject expired emails. Again, this is very simple:\n\n\texports.hook_rcpt = function (next, connection, params) {\n\t\tvar rcpt = params[0];\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Got recipient: \" + rcpt);\n\t\n\t\t// Check user matches regex 'user-YYYYMMDD':\n\t\tvar match = /^(.*)-(\\d{4})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})$/.exec(rcpt.user);\n\t\tif (!match) {\n\t\t\treturn next();\n\t\t}\n\t\n\t\t// get date - note Date constructor takes month-1 (i.e. Dec == 11).\n\t\tvar expiry_date = new Date(match[2], match[3]-1, match[4]);\n\t\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Email expires on: \" + expiry_date);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar today = new Date();\n\t\t\n\t\tif (expiry_date < today) {\n\t\t\t// If we get here, the email address has expired\n\t\t\treturn next(DENY, \"Expired email address\");\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\tnext();\n\t}\n\nAnd we can easily check that with swaks (remember to restart Haraka):\n\n    $ swaks -h foo.com -t booya-20110101@haraka.local -f somewhere@example.com \\\n      -s localhost -p 25\n\t=== Trying localhost:25...\n\t=== Connected to localhost.\n\t<-  220 sergeant.org ESMTP Haraka 0.3 ready\n\t -> EHLO foo.com\n\t<-  250-Haraka says hi Unknown [127.0.0.1]\n\t<-  250-PIPELINING\n\t<-  250-8BITMIME\n\t<-  250 SIZE 500000\n\t -> MAIL FROM:<somewhere@example.com>\n\t<-  250 From address is OK\n\t -> RCPT TO:<booya-20110101@haraka.local>\n\t<** 550 Expired email address\n\t -> QUIT\n\t<-  221 closing connection. Have a jolly good day.\n\t=== Connection closed with remote host.\n\nNow we need to do one more thing...\n\nFixing Up Unexpired Emails\n--------------------------\n\nThe last thing we need to do, is if we have an email that isn't expired, we\nneed to normalise it back to the real email address, because wherever we\ndeliver this to is unlikely to recognise these new email addresses.\n\nHere's how our final plugin will look:\n\n\texports.hook_rcpt = function (next, connection, params) {\n\t\tvar rcpt = params[0];\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Got recipient: \" + rcpt);\n\n\t\t// Check user matches regex 'user-YYYYMMDD':\n\t\tvar match = /^(.*)-(\\d{4})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})$/.exec(rcpt.user);\n\t\tif (!match) {\n\t\t\treturn next();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// get date - note Date constructor takes month-1 (i.e. Dec == 11).\n\t\tvar expiry_date = new Date(match[2], match[3]-1, match[4]);\n\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Email expires on: \" + expiry_date);\n\t\n\t\tvar today = new Date();\n\t\n\t\tif (expiry_date < today) {\n\t\t\t// If we get here, the email address has expired\n\t\t\treturn next(DENY, \"Expired email address\");\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t// now get rid of the extension:\n\t\trcpt.user = match[1];\n\t\tthis.loginfo(\"Email address now: \" + rcpt);\n\t\t\n\t\tnext();\n\t}\n\nAnd when we test this with an unexpired address via swaks:\n\n    $ swaks -h foo.com -t booya-20120101@haraka.local \\\n      -f somewhere@example.com -s localhost -p 25\n\nWe get in the logs:\n\n\t[INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Got recipient: <booya-20120101@haraka.local>\n\t[INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Email expires on: Sun Jan 01 2012 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST)\n\t[INFO] [rcpt_to.disposable] Email address now: <booya@haraka.local>\n\nWhich indicates that we have successfully modified the email address.\n\nFurther Reading\n===============\n\nThere are many more features of the Haraka API to explore, including access\nto the body of the email and the headers, access to the HELO string, and\nimplementing ESMTP extensions, among many others.\n\nThere are two good places to read up on these. Firstly is the documentation\nin the Haraka \"docs\" directory. Start with the `Plugins.md` file, and work\nyour way through the API from there.\n\nThe second place is simply reading the source code for the plugins themselves.\nThe plugins that Haraka ships with use almost all parts of the API and so\nshould give you a good starting point if you want to implement a particular\npiece of functionality. Even the most complicated plugins are under 200 lines\nof code, so don't be intimidated by them! The simplest one is a mere 5 lines\nof code.\n\n","dir":"/en/tutorials","path":"/en/tutorials/Tutorial","extension":".md","slug":"Tutorial","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.682Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T13:53:41.780Z","to":"/tutorials/Tutorial","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905511},"$loki":85},{"title":"Plugins","position":13,"category":"Core","toc":[{"id":"plugin-lists","depth":2,"text":"Plugin Lists"},{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"anatomy-of-a-plugin","depth":2,"text":"Anatomy of a Plugin"},{"id":"register","depth":3,"text":"Register"},{"id":"register-a-hook","depth":3,"text":"Register a Hook"},{"id":"register-a-hook-multiple-times","depth":3,"text":"Register a Hook Multiple Times"},{"id":"next","depth":3,"text":"Next()"},{"id":"available-hooks","depth":2,"text":"Available Hooks"},{"id":"rcpt","depth":3,"text":"rcpt"},{"id":"connect_init","depth":3,"text":"connect_init"},{"id":"hook_init_http-next-server","depth":3,"text":"hook_init_http (next, Server)"},{"id":"hook_init_wss-next-server","depth":3,"text":"hook_init_wss (next, Server)"},{"id":"pre_send_trans_email-next-fake_connection","depth":3,"text":"pre_send_trans_email (next, fake_connection)"},{"id":"hook-order","depth":2,"text":"Hook Order"},{"id":"plugin-run-order","depth":2,"text":"Plugin Run Order"},{"id":"logging","depth":2,"text":"Logging"},{"id":"sharing-state","depth":2,"text":"Sharing State"},{"id":"plugins-as-modules","depth":2,"text":"Plugins as Modules"},{"id":"shutdown","depth":2,"text":"Shutdown"},{"id":"further-reading","depth":2,"text":"Further Reading"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Most aspects of receiving an email in Haraka are controlled by plugins.

Mail cannot even be received unless at least a 'rcpt' and 'queue' plugin are\nenabled.\n\nRecipient (*rcpt*) plugins determine if a particular recipient is allowed to be relayed or received for. A *queue* plugin queues the message somewhere - normally to disk or to an another SMTP server.\n\n## Plugin Lists\n\nGet a list of installed plugins by running `haraka -l`. To include locally installed plugins, add the `-c /path/to/config` option.\n\nWe also have a [registry of known plugins](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/blob/master/Plugins.md).\n\nDisplay the help text for a plugin by running:\n\n`haraka -h <name> -c /path/to/config`\n\n# Writing Haraka Plugins\n\n## Overview\n\n\n\n## Anatomy of a Plugin\n\nPlugins in Haraka are JS files in the `plugins` directory (legacy) and npm\nmodules in the node\\_modules directory. See \"Plugins as Modules\" below.\n\nPlugins can be installed in the Haraka global directory (default:\n/$os/$specific/lib/node\\_modules/Haraka) or in the Haraka install directory\n(whatever you chose when you typed `haraka -i`. Example: `haraka -i /etc/haraka`\n\nTo enable a plugin, add its name to `config/plugins`. For npm packaged plugins, the name does not include the `haraka-plugin` prefix.\n\n### Register\n\nRegister is the only plugin function that is syncronous and receives no arguments. Its primary purpose is enabling your plugin to register SMTP hooks. It is also used for syncronous initialization tasks such as [loading a config file](https://github.com/haraka/haraka-config). For heavier initialization tasks such as establishing database connections, look to `init_master` and `init_child` instead.\n\n### Register a Hook\n\nThere are two ways for plugins to register hooks. Both examples register a function on the *rcpt* hook:\n\n1. The `register_hook` function in register():\n\n    exports.register = function() {\n        this.register_hook('rcpt', 'my_rcpt_validate');\n    };\n\n    exports.my_rcpt_validate = function (next, connection, params) {\n        // do processing\n        next();\n    };\n\n2. The hook_[$name] syntax:\n\n    exports.hook_rcpt = function (next, connection, params) {\n        // do processing\n        next();\n    };\n\nThe register_hook function within `register()` offers a few advantages:\n\n    1. register a hook multiple times (see below)\n    2. a unique function name in stack traces\n    3. [a better function name](https://google.com/search?q=programming%20good%20function%20names)\n    4. hooks can be registered conditionally (ie, based on a config setting)\n\n### Register a Hook Multiple Times\n\nTo register the same hook more than once, call `register_hook()` multiple times with the same hook name:\n\n    exports.register = function() {\n        this.register_hook('queue', 'try_queue_my_way');\n        this.register_hook('queue', 'try_queue_highway');\n    };\n\nWhen `try_queue_my_way()` calls `next()`, the next function registered on hook *queue* will be called, in this case, `try_queue_highway()`.\n\n#### Determine hook name\n\nWhen a single function runs on multiple hooks, the function can check the\n*hook* property of the *connection* or *hmail* argument to determine which hook it is running on:\n\n    exports.register = function() {\n        this.register_hook('rcpt',    'my_rcpt');\n        this.register_hook('rcpt_ok', 'my_rcpt');\n    };\n     \n    exports.my_rcpt = function (next, connection, params) {\n        var hook_name = connection.hook; // rcpt or rcpt_ok\n        // email address is in params[0]\n        // do processing\n    }\n\n\n### Next()\n\nAfter registering a hook, functions are called with that hooks arguments (see **Available Hooks** below. The first argument is a callback function, conventionally named `next`. When the function is completed, it calls `next()` and the connection continues. Failing to call `next()` will result in the connection hanging until that plugin's timer expires.\n\n`next([code, msg])` accepts two optional parameters:\n\n1. `code` is one of the listed return codes.\n2. `msg` is a string to send to the client in case of a failure. Use an array to send a multi-line message. `msg` should NOT contain the code number - that is handled by Haraka.\n\n#### Next() Return Codes\n\nThese constants are in your plugin when it is loaded, you do not\nneed to define them:\n\n* CONT\n\n  Continue and let other plugins handle this particular hook. This is the\n  default. These are identical: `next()` and `next(CONT)`;\n\n* DENY - Reject with a 5xx error.\n\n* DENYSOFT - Reject with a 4xx error.\n\n* DENYDISCONNECT - Reject with a 5xx error and immediately disconnect.\n\n* DISCONNECT - Immediately disconnect\n\n* OK\n\n  Required by `rcpt` plugins to accept a recipient and `queue` plugins when the queue was successful.\n\n  After a plugin calls `next(OK)`, no further plugins on that hook will run.\n\n  Exceptions to next(OK):\n\n    * connect_init and disconnect hooks are **always called**.\n\n    * On the deny hook, `next(OK)` overrides the default CONT.\n\n* HOOK\\_NEXT\n\n  HOOK_NEXT is only available on the `unrecognized_command` hook. It instructs Haraka to run a different plugin hook. The `msg` argument must be set to the name of the hook to be run. Ex: `next(HOOK_NEXT, 'rcpt_ok');`\n\n## Available Hooks\n\nThese are the hook and their parameters (next excluded):\n\n* init\\_master - called when the main (master) process is started\n* init\\_child - in cluster, called when a child process is started\n* init\\_http - called when Haraka is started.\n* init_wss - called after init_http\n* connect\\_init - used to init data structures, called for *every* connection\n* lookup\\_rdns - called to look up the rDNS - return the rDNS via `next(OK, rdns)`\n* connect - called after we got rDNS\n* capabilities - called to get the ESMTP capabilities (such as STARTTLS)\n* unrecognized\\_command - called when the remote end sends a command we don't recognise\n* disconnect - called upon disconnect\n* helo (hostname)\n* ehlo (hostname)\n* quit\n* vrfy\n* noop\n* rset\n* mail ([from, esmtp\\_params])\n* rcpt ([to,   esmtp\\_params])\n* rcpt\\_ok (to)\n* data - called at the DATA command\n* data\\_post - called at the end-of-data marker\n* max\\_data\\_exceeded - called when the message exceeds connection.max\\_bytes\n* queue - called to queue the mail\n* queue\\_outbound - called to queue the mail when connection.relaying is set\n* queue\\_ok - called when a mail has been queued successfully\n* reset\\_transaction - called before the transaction is reset (via RSET, or MAIL)\n* deny - called when a plugin returns DENY, DENYSOFT or DENYDISCONNECT\n* get\\_mx (hmail, domain) - called by outbound to resolve the MX record\n* deferred (hmail, params) - called when an outbound message is deferred\n* bounce (hmail, err) - called when an outbound message bounces\n* delivered (hmail, [host, ip, response, delay, port, mode, ok_recips, secured, authenticated]) - called when outbound mail is delivered\n* send\\_email (hmail) - called when outbound is about to be sent\n* pre\\_send\\_trans\\_email (fake_connection) - called just before an email is queued to disk with a faked connection object\n\n### rcpt\n\nThe *rcpt* hook is slightly special.\n\nWhen **connection.relaying == false** (the default, to avoid being an open relay), a rcpt plugin MUST return `next(OK)` or the sender will receive the error message \"I cannot deliver for that user\". The default *rcpt* plugin  is **rcpt_to.in_host_list**, which lists the domains for which to accept email.\n\nAfter a *rcpt* plugin calls `next(OK)`, the *rcpt_ok* hook is run.\n\nIf a plugin prior to the *rcpt* hook sets **connection.relaying = true**, then it is not necessary for a rcpt plugin to call `next(OK)`.\n\n### connect_init\n\nThe `connect_init` hook is unique in that all return codes are ignored. This is so that plugins that need to do initialization for every connection can be assured they will run. Return values are ignored.\n\n### hook_init_http (next, Server)\n\nIf http listeners are are enabled in http.ini and the express module loaded, the express library will be located at Server.http.express. More importantly, the express [app / instance](http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html#app) will be located at Server.http.app. Plugins can register routes on the app just as they would with any [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) app.\n\n### hook_init_wss (next, Server)\n\nIf express loaded, an attempt is made to load [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws), the websocket server. If it succeeds, the wss server will be located at Server.http.wss. Because of how websockets work, only one websocket plugin will work at a time. One plugin using wss is [watch](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/tree/master/plugins/watch).\n\n### pre\\_send\\_trans\\_email (next, fake_connection)\n\nThe `fake` connection here is a holder for a new transaction object. It only has the log methods and a `transaction` property\nso don't expect it to behave like a a real connection object. This hook is designed so you can add headers and modify mails\nsent via `outbound.send_email()`, see the dkim_sign plugin for an example.\n\n## Hook Order\n\nThe ordering of hooks is determined by the SMTP protocol. Knowledge of [RFC 5321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321) is beneficial.\n\n##### Typical Inbound Connection\n\n- hook_connect_init\n- hook_lookup_rdns\n- hook_connect\n- hook_helo **OR** hook_ehlo (EHLO is sent when ESMTP is desired which allows extensions\nsuch as STARTTLS, AUTH, SIZE etc.)\n    - hook_helo\n    - hook_ehlo\n      - hook_capabilities\n      - *hook_unrecognized_command* is run for each ESMTP extension the client requests\ne.g. STARTTLS, AUTH etc.)\n  - hook_mail\n  - hook_rcpt (once per-recipient)\n  - hook_rcpt_ok (for every recipient that hook_rcpt returned `next(OK)` for)\n  - hook_data\n  - *[attachment hooks]*\n  - hook_data_post\n  - hook_queue **OR** hook_queue_outbound\n  - hook_queue_ok (called if hook_queue or hook_queue_outbound returns `next(OK)`)\n- hook_quit **OR** hook_rset **OR** hook_helo **OR** hook_ehlo (after a message has been sent or rejected, the client can disconnect or start a new transaction with RSET, EHLO or HELO)\n  - hook_reset_transaction\n- hook_disconnect\n\n##### Typical Outbound mail\n\nBy 'outbound' we mean messages using Haraka's built-in queue and delivery\nmechanism. The Outbound queue is used when `connection.relaying = true` is set during the  transaction and `hook_queue_outbound` is called to queue the message.\n\nThe Outbound hook ordering mirrors the Inbound hook order above until after `hook_queue_outbound`, which is followed by:\n\n- hook_send_email\n- hook_get_mx\n- at least one of:\n  - hook_delivered  (once per delivery domain with at least one successful recipient)\n  - hook_deferred  (once per delivery domain where at least one recipient or connection was deferred)\n  - hook_bounce  (once per delivery domain where the recipient(s) or message was rejected by the destination)\n\n## Plugin Run Order\n\nPlugins are run on each hook in the order that they are specified in `config/plugins`. When a plugin returns anything other than `next()` on a hook, all subsequent plugins due to run on that hook are skipped (exceptions: connect_init, disconnect).\n\nThis is important as some plugins might rely on `results` or `notes` that have been set by plugins that need to run before them. This should be noted in the plugins documentation. Make sure to read it.\n\nIf you are writing a complex plugin, you may have to split it into multiple plugins to run in a specific order e.g. you want hook_deny to run last after all other plugins and hook_lookup_rdns to run first, then you can explicitly register your hooks and provide a `priority` value which is an integer between -100 (highest priority) to 100 (lowest priority) which defaults to 0 (zero) if not supplied.  You can apply a priority to your hook in the following way:\n\n````\nexports.register = function() {\n    var plugin = this;\n    plugin.register_hook('connect',  'hook_connect', -100);\n}\n````\n\nThis would ensure that your hook_connect function will run before any other\nplugins registered on the `connect` hook, regardless of the order it was\nspecified in `config/plugins`.\n\nCheck the order that the plugins will run on each hook by running:\n\n`haraka -o -c /path/to/config`\n\n## Logging\n\nPlugins inherit all the logging methods of `logger.js`, which are:\n\n* logprotocol\n* logdebug\n* loginfo\n* lognotice\n* logwarn\n* logerror\n* logcrit\n* logalert\n* logemerg\n\nIf plugins throw an exception when in a hook, the exception will be caught\nand generate a logcrit level error. However, exceptions will not be caught\nas gracefully when plugins are running async code. Use error codes for that,\nlog the error, and run your next() function appropriately.\n\n## Sharing State\n\nThere are several cases where you might need to share information between\nplugins.  This is done using `notes` - there are three types available:\n\n* server.notes\n\n  Available in all plugins.  This is created at PID start-up and is shared\n  amongst all plugins on the same PID and listener.\n  Typical uses for notes at this level would be to share database\n  connections between multiple plugins or connection pools etc.\n\n* connection.notes\n\n  Available on any hook that passes 'connection' as a function parameter.\n  This is shared amongst all plugins for a single connection and is\n  destroyed after the client disconnects.\n  Typical uses for notes at this level would be to store information\n  about the connected client e.g. rDNS names, HELO/EHLO, white/black\n  list status etc.\n\n* connection.transaction.notes\n\n  Available on any hook that passes 'connection' as a function parameter\n  between hook\\_mail and hook\\_data\\_post.\n  This is shared amongst all plugins for this transaction (e.g. MAIL FROM\n  through until a message is received or the connection is reset).\n  Typical uses for notes at this level would be to store information\n  on things like greylisting which uses client, sender and recipient\n  information etc.\n\n* hmail.todo.notes\n\n  Available on any outbound hook that passes `hmail` as a function parameter.\n  This is the same object as 'connection.transaction.notes', so anything\n  you store in the transaction notes is automatically available in the\n  outbound functions here.\n\nAll of these notes are JS objects - use them as simple key/value store e.g.\n\n    connection.transaction.notes.test = 'testing';\n\n## Plugins as Modules\n\nPlugins as NPM modules are named with the `haraka-plugin` prefix. Therefore, a\nplugin that frobnobricates might be called `haraka-plugin-frobnobricate` and\npublished to NPM with that name. The prefix is not required in the\n`config/plugins` file.\n\nPlugins loaded as NPM modules behave slightly different than plugins loaded\nas plain JS files.\n\nPlain JS plugins have a custom `require()` which allows loading core Haraka\nmodules via specifying `require('./name')` (note the `./` prefix). Although\nthe core modules aren't in the same folder, the custom `require` intercepts\nthis and look for core modules. Note that if there is a module in your plugins\nfolder of the same name that will not take preference, so avoid using names\nsimilar to core modules.\n\nPlugins loaded as modules do not have the special `require()`. To load\na core Haraka module you must use `this.haraka_require('name')`.\nThis should also be preferred for plain JS plugins, as the\n`./` hack is likely to be removed in the future.\n\nPlugins loaded as modules are not compiled in the Haraka plugin sandbox,\nwhich blocks access to certain globals and provides a global `server` object.\nTo access the `server` object, use `connection.server` instead.\n\nModule plugins support default config in their local `config` directory. See the\n\"Default Config and Overrides\" section in [Config](Config).\n\n## Shutdown\n\nOn graceful reload, Haraka will call a plugin's `shutdown` method.\n\nThis is so you can clear any timers or intervals, or shut down any connections\nto remote servers. See [Issue 2024](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/issues/2024).\n\ne.g.\n\n    exports.shutdown = function () {\n        clearInterval(this._interval);\n    }\n\nIf you don't implement this in your plugin and have a connection open or a\ntimer running then Haraka will take 30 seconds to shut down and have to\nforcibly kill your process.\n\nNote: This only applies when running with a `nodes=...` value in smtp.ini.\n\nSee also, [Results](Results)\n\n\nFurther Reading\n--------------\n\nRead about the [Connection](Connection) object.\n\nOutbound hooks are [also documented](Outbound).\n\n","dir":"/en/core","path":"/en/core/Plugins","extension":".md","slug":"Plugins","createdAt":"2020-08-22T20:17:10.388Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-22T15:19:40.186Z","to":"/core/Plugins","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1598127905568},"$loki":86},{"title":"auth/auth_vpopmaild","position":23,"category":"Plugins","toc":[{"id":"configuration","depth":2,"text":"Configuration"},{"id":"per-domain-configuration","depth":3,"text":"Per-domain Configuration"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"auth/vpopmaild"}]},{"type":"text","value":" plugin allows you to authenticate against a vpopmaild\ndaemon."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"configuration"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#configuration","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Configuration"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Configuration is stored in "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"config/auth_vpopmaild.ini"}]},{"type":"text","value":" and uses INI\nstyle formatting."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are three configuration settings:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"host: The host/IP that vpopmaild is listening on (default: localhost)."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"port: The TCP port that vpopmaild is listening on (default: 89)."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"sysadmin: A colon separated username:password of a vpopmail user with\nSYSADMIN privileges (see vpopmail/bin/vmoduser -S).

This is a common setup when you\nwant to have a mail server with a solid pedigree of outbound delivery to\nother hosts, and inbound delivery to users.\n\nIn comparison to `queue/smtp_proxy`, this plugin waits until queue time to\nattempt the ongoing connection. This can be a benefit in reducing connections\nto your inbound mail server when you have content filtering (such as\nspamassassin) enabled. A possible downside is that it also delays recipient\nvalidation that the ongoing mail server may provide until queue time.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\n* smtp\\_forward.ini\n\n  Configuration is stored in this file in the following keys:\n\n  * enable\\_outbound=[true]\n\n    SMTP forward outbound messages (set to false to enable Haraka's separate\n    Outbound mail routing (MX based delivery)).\n\n  * host=HOST\n\n    The host to connect to.\n\n  * port=PORT\n\n    The port to connect to. Default: 25\n\n  * connect\\_timeout=SECONDS\n\n    The maximum amount of time to wait when creating a new connection\n    to the host.  Default: 30 seconds.\n\n  * timeout=SECONDS\n\n    The amount of seconds to let a backend connection live idle in the\n    connection pool.  This should always be less than the global plugin\n    timeout, which should in turn be less than the connection timeout.\n\n  * max\\_connections=NUMBER\n\n    Maximum number of connections at any given time. Default: 1000\n\n  * enable\\_tls=[true]\n\n    Enable TLS with the forward host (if supported). TLS uses options\n    from the tls plugin. If key and cert are provided in the the outbound section of the tls plugin,\n    that certificate will be used as a TLS Client Certificate.\n\n    This option controls the use of TLS via `STARTTLS`. This plugin does not work with\n    SMTP over TLS.\n\n  * auth\\_type=[plain\\|login]\n\n    Enable PLAIN or LOGIN SMTP AUTH.  This is required to enable AUTH.\n\n  * auth\\_user=USERNAME\n\n    SMTP AUTH username to use.\n\n  * auth\\_pass=PASSWORD\n\n    SMTP AUTH password to use.\n\n  * queue\n\n    Which queue plugin to use. Default: undefined. The default bahavior is to\n    use smtp_forward for inbound connections and outbound for relaying\n    connections. This option is used for complex mail routes.\n\n  * check_sender=false\n\n    Requires that sender domains defined in smtp_forward.ini (see Per-Domain below) have relaying privileges. This is a form of spoof prevention and assumes that any mail clients have relaying or AUTH privileges. This is usually the case.\n\n  * check_recipient=false\n\n    By default, Haraka accepts no emails until a recipient plugin has been configured to accept mails for a domain. The simplest common case is the in_host_list plugin with a list of domains in config/host_list. An alternative is to set `check_recipient=true` and list each domain in a definition block in smtp_forward.ini (see Per-Domain Configuration). An example for two domains:\n\n    [example.com]\n    [example.net]\n\n# Per-Domain Configuration\n\nMore specific forward routes for domains can be defined. The domain is\nchosen based on the value of the `domain_selector` config variable.\n\nWhen `domain_selector` is set to `rcpt_to` (the default), more specific\nroutes are only honored for SMTP connections with a single recipient or SMTP\nconnections where every recipient host is identical.\n\nWhen `domain_selector` is set to `mail_from`, the domain of the MAIL FROM\naddress is used.\n\nenable\\_outbound can be set or unset on a per-domain level to enable or disable\nforwarding for specific domains.\n\n    # default SMTP host\n    host=1.2.3.4\n    # auth_type=plain\n    # auth_user=user\n    # auth_user=pass\n\n    [example1.com]\n    host=1.2.3.5\n    # auth_type=plain\n    # auth_user=user\n    # auth_pass=pass\n\n    [example2.com]\n    host=1.2.3.5\n\n    [example3.com]\n    host=1.2.3.6\n\n    [example4.com]\n    enable\\_outbound=false\n\n# Split host forward routing\n\nWhen an incoming email transaction has multiple recipients with different forward routes,  recipients to subsequent forward routes are deferred. Example: an incoming email transaction has recipients user@example1.com, user@example2.com, and user@example3.com. The first two messages will be accepted (they share the same forward destination) and the latter one will be deferred. It will arrive in a future delivery attempt by the
